            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What a Poet and Poeſie is, and who may be worthily ſayd the moſt excellent Poet of our time.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Poet is as much to ſay as a maker. And our Engliſh name well conformes with the Greeke word: for of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to make, they call a maker <hi>Poeta.</hi> Such as (by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance and reuerently) we may ſay of God: who without any trauell to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine imagination, made all the world of nought, nor alſo by any paterne or mould as the Platonicks with their Idees do phantaſtically ſuppoſe. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo the very Poet makes and contriues out of his owne braine, both the verſe and matter of his poeme, and not by any foreine copie or example, as doth the tranſlator, who therefore may well be ſayd a verſifier, but not a Poet. The premiſes conſidered, it giueth to the name and profeſſion no ſmal dignitie and preheminence, aboue all other artificers, Scientificke or Mechanicall. And neuertheleſſe without any repugnancie at all, a Poet may in ſome ſort be ſaid a follower or imitator, becauſe he can expreſſe the true and liuely of euery thing is ſet before him, and which he taketh in hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe: and ſo in that reſpect is both a maker and a counterfaitor: and Poeſie an art not only of making, but alſo of imitation. And this ſcience in his perfection, can not grow, but by ſome diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, the Platonicks call it <hi>furor:</hi> or by excellencie of nature and complexion: or by great ſubtiltie of the ſpirits &amp; wit, or by much experience and obſeruation of the world, and courſe of kinde, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11025:4"/>
peraduenture by all or moſt part of them. Otherwiſe how was it poſſible that <hi>Homer</hi> being but a poore priuate man, and as ſome ſay, in his later age blind, ſhould ſo exactly ſet foorth and deſcribe, as if he had bene a moſt excellent Captaine or Generall, the order and array of battels, the conduct of whole armies, the ſieges and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of cities and townes? or as ſome great Princes maiordome and perfect Surueyour in Court, the order, ſumptuouſneſſe and magnificence of royal bankets, feaſts, weddings, and enteruewes? or as a Polititian very prudent, and much inured with the priuat and publique affaires, ſo grauely examine the lawes and ordinances Ciuill, or ſo profoundly diſcourſe in matters of eſtate, and formes of all politique regiment? Finally how could he ſo naturally paint out the ſpeeches, countenance and maners of Princely perſons and priuate, to wit, the wrath of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the magnanimitie of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> the prudence of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> the proweſſe of <hi>Hector,</hi> the maieſtie of king <hi>Priamus,</hi> the grauitie of <hi>Neſtor,</hi> the pollicies and eloquence of <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> the calamities of the diſtreſſed <hi>Queenes,</hi> and valiance of all the Captaines and aduenturous knights in thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable warres of Troy? It is therefore of Poets thus to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that if they be able to deuiſe and make all theſe things of them ſelues, without any ſubiect of veritie, that they be (by maner of ſpeech) as creating gods. If they do it by inſtinct diuine or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, then ſurely much fauoured from aboue. If by their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then no doubt very wiſe men. If by any preſident or paterne layd before them, then truly the moſt excellent imitators &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaitors of all others. But you (Madame) my moſt Honored and Gracious: if I ſhould ſeeme to offer you this my deuiſe for a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and not a delight, I might well be reputed, of all others the moſt arrogant and iniurious: your ſelfe being alreadie, of any that I know in our time, the moſt excellent Poet. Forſooth by your Princely purſe fauours and countenance, making in maner what ye liſt, the poore man rich, the lewd well learned, the coward cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and vile both noble and valiant. Then for imitation no leſſe; your perſon as a moſt cunning counterfaitor liuely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>Venus</hi> in countenance, in life <hi>Diana, Pallas</hi> for gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Iuno</hi> in all honour and regall magnificence.</p>

                  <p>That there may be an Art of our Engliſh Poeſie, aſwell as there is of the Latine and Greeke.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THen as there was no art in the world till by experience found out: ſo if Poeſie be now an Art, &amp; of al antiquitie hath bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greeks and Latines, &amp; yet were none, vntill by ſtudious perſons faſhioned and reduced into a method of rules &amp; precepts, then no doubt may there be the like with vs. And if th'art of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie be but a skill appertaining to vtterance, why may not the ſame be with vs aſwel as with them, our language being no leſſe copious pithie and ſignificatiue then theirs, our conceipts the ſame, and our wits no leſſe apt to deuiſe and imitate then theirs were? If againe Art be but a certaine order of rules preſcribed by reaſon, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by experience, why ſhould not Poeſie be a vulgar Art with vs aſwell as with the Greeks and Latines, our language admitting no fewer rules and nice diuerſities then theirs? but peraduenture moe by a peculiar, which our ſpeech hath in many things differing from theirs: and yet in the generall points of that Art, allowed to go in common with them: ſo as if one point perchance which is their feete whereupon their meaſures ſtand, and in deede is all the beautie of their Poeſie, and which feete we haue not, nor as yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer went about to frame (the nature of our language and wordes not permitting it) we haue in ſtead thereof twentie other curious points in that skill more then they euer had, by reaſon of our rime and tunable concords or ſimphonie, which they neuer obſerued. Poeſie therefore may be an Art in our vulgar, and that verie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall and commendable.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe profeſſion and vſe of Poeſie is moſt ancient from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and not as manie erroniouſly ſuppoſe, after, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ciuil ſociety was among men. For it is written, that Poeſie was th'originall cauſe and occaſion of their firſt aſſemblies, when before the people remained in the woods and mountains, vagarant and diperſed like the wild beaſts, lawleſſe and naked, or verie ill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11025:5"/>
clad, and of all good and neceſſarie prouiſion for harbour or ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vtterly vnfurniſhed: ſo as they litle diffred for their maner of life, from the very brute beaſts of the field. Whereupon it is fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Amphion</hi> and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> two Poets of the firſt ages, one of them, to wit <hi>Amphion,</hi> builded vp cities, and reared walles with the ſtones that came in heapes to the ſound of his harpe, figuring thereby the mollifying of hard and ſtonie hearts by his ſweete and eloquent perſwaſion. And <hi>Orpheus</hi> aſſembled the wilde beaſts to come in heards to harken to his muſicke, and by that meanes made them tame, implying thereby, how by his diſcreete and wholſome leſſons vttered in harmonie and with melodious inſtruments, he brought the rude and ſauage people to a more ciuill and orderly life, nothing, as it ſeemeth, more preuailing or fit to redreſſe and edifie the cruell and ſturdie courage of man then it. And as theſe two Poets and <hi>Linus</hi> before them, and <hi>Muſeus</hi> alſo and <hi>Heſiodus</hi> in Greece and Archadia: ſo by all likelihood had mo Poets done in other places, and in other ages before them, though there be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance left of them, by reaſon of the Recordes by ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of time periſhed and failing. Poets therfore are of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. Then foraſmuch as they were the firſt that entended to the obſeruation of nature and her works, and ſpecially of the Celeſtiall courſes, by reaſon of the continuall motion of the heauens, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after the firſt mouer, and from thence by degrees comming to know and conſider of the ſubſtances ſeparate &amp; abſtract, which we call the diuine intelligences or good Angels <hi>(Demones)</hi> they were the firſt that inſtituted ſacrifices of placation, with inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and worſhip to them, as to Gods: and inuented and ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all the reſt of the obſeruances and ceremonies of religion, and ſo were the firſt Prieſts and miniſters of the holy miſteries. And becauſe for the better execution of that high charge and function, it behoued them to liue chaſt, and in all holines of life, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſtudie and contemplation: they came by inſtinct diuine, and by deepe meditation, and much abſtinence (the ſame aſſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and refining their ſpirits) to be made apt to receaue viſions, both waking and ſleeping, which made them vtter propheſies, and foretell things to come. So alſo were they the firſt Prophetes or ſeears, <hi>Videntes,</hi> for ſo the Scripture tearmeth them in Latine after

the Hebrue word, and all the oracles and anſwers of the gods were giuen in meeter or verſe, and publiſhed to the people by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And for that they were aged and graue men, and of much wiſedome and experience in th'affaires of the world, they were the firſt lawmakers to the people, and the firſt polititiens, deuiſing all expedient meanes for th'eſtabliſhment of Common wealth, to hold and containe the people in order and duety by force and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of good and wholeſome lawes, made for the preſeruation of the publique peace and tranquillitie. The ſame peraduenture not purpoſely intended, but greatly furthered by the aw of their gods, and ſuch ſcruple of conſcience, as the terrors of their late inuented religion had led them into.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Poets were the firſt Philoſophers, the firſt Aſtronomers and Hiſtoriographers and Oratours and Muſitiens of the world.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VTterance alſo and language is giuen by nature to man for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of others, and aide of them ſelues, I meane the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilite to ſpeake. For ſpeech it ſelfe is artificiall and made by man, and the more pleaſing it is, the more it preuaileth to ſuch purpoſe as it is intended for: but ſpeech by meeter is a kind of vtterance, more cleanly couched and more delicate to the eare then proſe is, becauſe it is more currant and ſlipper vpon the tongue, and withal tunable and melodious, as a kind of Muſicke, and therfore may be tearmed a muſicall ſpeech or vtterance, which cannot but pleaſe the hearer very well. Another cauſe is, for that it is briefer &amp; more compendious, and eaſier to beare away and be retained in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then that which is contained in multitude of words and full of tedious ambage and long periods. It is beſide a maner of vtterance more eloquent and rethoricall then the ordinarie proſe, which we vſe in our daily talke: becauſe it is decked and ſet out with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of freſh colours and figures, which maketh that it ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uegleth the iudgement of man, and carieth his opinion this way and that, whither ſoeuer the heart by impreſſion of the eare ſhalbe moſt affectionatly bent and directed. The vtterance in proſe is not of ſo great efficacie, becauſe not only it is dayly vſed, and by that occaſion the eare is ouerglutted with it, but is alſo not ſo voluble
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11025:6"/>
and ſlipper vpon the tong, being wide and loſe, and nothing nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, nor contriued into meaſures, and ſounded with ſo gallant and harmonical accents, nor in fine alowed that figuratiue conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor ſo great licence in choiſe of words and phraſes as meeter is. So as the Poets were alſo from the beginning the beſt perſwaders and their eloquence the firſt Rethoricke of the world. Euen ſo it became that the high myſteries of the gods ſhould be reuealed &amp; taught, by a maner of vtterance and language of extraordinarie phraſe, and briefe and compendious, and aboue al others ſweet and ciuill as the Metricall is. The ſame alſo was meeteſt to regiſter the liues and noble geſts of Princes, and of the great Monarkes of the world, and all other the memorable accidents of time: ſo as the Poet was alſo the firſt hiſtoriographer. Then foraſmuch as they were the firſt obſeruers of all naturall cauſes &amp; effects in the things generable and corruptible, and from thence mounted vp to ſearch after the celeſtiall courſes and influences, &amp; yet penetrated further to know the diuine eſſences and ſubſtances ſeparate, as is ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were the firſt Aſtronomers and Philoſophiſts and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphiſicks. Finally, becauſe they did altogether endeuor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to reduce the life of man to a certaine method of good maners, and made the firſt differences betweene vertue and vice, and then tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered all theſe knowledges and skilles with the exerciſe of a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable Muſicke by melodious inſtruments, which withall ſerued them to delight their hearers, &amp; to call the people together by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, to a plauſible and vertuous conuerſation, therefore were they the firſt Philoſophers Ethick, &amp; the firſt artificial Muſiciens of the world. Such was <hi>Linus, Orpheus, Amphio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> &amp; <hi>Muſeus</hi> the moſt ancient Poets and Philoſophers, of whom there is left any memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the prophane writers. King <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſonne and many other of the holy Prophets wrate in meeters, and vſed to ſing them to the harpe, although to many of vs ignorant of the Hebrue language and phraſe, and not obſeruing it, the ſame ſeeme but a proſe. It can not bee therefore that anie ſcorne or indignitie ſhould iuſtly be offred to ſo noble, profitable, ancient and diuine a ſcience as Poeſie is.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the wilde and ſauage people vſed a naturall Poeſie in verſicle and rime as our vulgar is.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:11025:6"/>ANd the Greeke and Latine Poeſie was by verſe numerous and metricall, running vpon pleaſant feete, ſometimes ſwift, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſlow (their words very aptly ſeruing that purpoſe) but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rime or tunable concord in th'end of their verſes, as we and all other nations now vſe. But the Hebrues &amp; Chaldees who were more ancient then the Greekes, did not only vſe a metricall Poeſie, but alſo with the ſame a maner of rime, as hath bene of late obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by learned men. Wherby it appeareth, that our vulgar running Poeſie was common to all the nations of the world beſides, whom the Latines and Greekes in ſpeciall called barbarous. So as it was notwithſtanding the firſt and moſt ancient Poeſie, and the moſt vniuerſall, which two points do otherwiſe giue to all humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions and affaires no ſmall credit. This is proued by certificate of marchants &amp; trauellers, who by late nauigations haue ſurueyed the whole world, and diſcouered large countries and ſtrange peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wild and ſauage, affirming that the American, the Peruſine &amp; the very Canniball, do ſing and alſo ſay, their higheſt and holieſt matters in certaine riming verſicles and not in proſe, which proues alſo that our maner of vulgar Poeſie is more ancient then the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall of the Greeks and Latines, ours comming by inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was before Art or obſeruation, and vſed with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and vnciuill, who were before all ſcience or ciuilitie, euen as the naked by prioritie of time is before the clothed, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant before the learned. The naturall Poeſie therefore being aided and amended by Art, and not vtterly altered or obſcured, but ſome ſigne left of it, (as the Greekes and Latines haue left none) is no leſſe to be allowed and commended then theirs.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the riming Poeſie came firſt to the Grecians and Latines, and had altered and almoſt ſpilt their maner of Poeſie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BVt it came to paſſe, when fortune fled farre from the Greekes and Latines, &amp; that their townes floriſhed no more in traficke, nor their Vniuerſities in learning as they had done continuing thoſe Monarchies: the barbarous conquerers inuading them with innumerable ſwarmes of ſtrange nations, the Poeſie metricall of the Grecians and Latines came to be much corrupted and altered,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11025:7"/>
in ſo much as there were times that the very Greekes and Latines themſelues tooke pleaſure in Riming verſes, and vſed it as a rare and gallant thing: Yea their Oratours proſes nor the Doctors Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were acceptable to Princes nor yet to the common people vnleſſe it went in manner of tunable rime or metricall ſentences, as appeares by many of the auncient writers, about that time and ſince. And the great Princes, and Popes, and Sultans would one ſalute and greet an other ſometime in frendſhip and ſport, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in earneſt and enmitie by ryming verſes, &amp; nothing ſeemed clerkly done, but muſt be done in ryme: Whereof we finde diuers examples from the time of th'Emperours Gracian &amp; Valentinian downwardes: For then aboutes began the declination of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Empire, by the notable inundations of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles</hi> in Europe, vnder the conduict of <hi>Totila</hi> &amp; <hi>Atila</hi> and other their generalles. This brought the ryming Poeſie in grace, and made it preuaile in Italie and Greece (their owne long time caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and almoſt neglected) till after many yeares that the peace of Italie and of th'Empire Occidentall reuiued new clerkes, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering and peruſing the bookes and ſtudies of the ciuiler ages, reſtored all maner of arts, and that of the Greeke and Latine Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie withall into their former puritie and netnes. Which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe did not ſo preuaile, but that the ryming Poeſie of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians remained ſtill in his reputation, that one in the ſchole, this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Courts of Princes more ordinary and allowable.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ANd this appeareth euidently by the workes of many learned men, who wrote about the time of <hi>Charlemaines</hi> raigne in the Empire <hi>Occidentall,</hi> where the Chriſtian Religion, became through the exceſſiue authoritie of Popes, and deepe deuotion of Princes ſtrongly fortified and eſtabliſhed by erection of orders <hi>Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> in which many ſimple clerks for deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake &amp; ſanctitie were receiued more then for any learning, by which occaſion &amp; the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe of their life, waxing ſtudious without diſcipline or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by any good methode, ſome of them grew to be hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers,

ſome Poets, and following either the barbarous rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the time, or els their own idle inuentions, all that they wrote to the fauor or prayſe of Princes, they did it in ſuch maner of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrelſie, and thought themſelues no ſmall fooles, when they could make their verſes goe all in ryme as did the ſchoole of <hi>Salerne,</hi> dedicating their booke of medicinall rules vnto our king of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, with this beginning.</p>

                  <p>In what reputation Poeſie and Poets were in old time with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and otherwiſe generally, and hovv they be novv become contemptible and for what cauſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr the reſpectes aforeſayd in all former ages and in the moſt ciuill countreys and commons wealthes, good Poets and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie were highly eſteemed and much fauoured of the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For proofe whereof we read how much <hi>Amyntas</hi> king of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> made of the Tragicall Poet <hi>Euripides.</hi> And the <hi>Athenians</hi> of <hi>Sophocles.</hi> In what price the noble poemes of <hi>Homer</hi> were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, in ſo much as euery night they were layd vnder his pillow, and by day were carried in the rich iewell cofer of <hi>Darius</hi> lately before vanquiſhed by him in battaile. And not onely <hi>Homer</hi> the father and Prince of the Poets was ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, but for his ſake all other meaner Poets, in ſo much as <hi>Cherillus</hi> one no very great good Poet had for euery verſe well made a <hi>Phillips</hi> noble of gold, amounting in value to an angell En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and ſo for euery hundreth verſes (which a cleanely pen could ſpeedely diſpatch (he had a hundred angels. And ſince <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the great how <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Greeke Poet was fauored by <hi>Tholomee</hi> king of Egipt &amp; Queene <hi>Berenice</hi> his wife, <hi>Ennius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by <hi>Scipio</hi> Prince of the <hi>Romaines, Virgill</hi> alſo by th'Emperour <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And in later times how much were <hi>Iehan de Mehune</hi> &amp; <hi>Guillaume de Loris</hi> made of by the French kinges, and <hi>Geffrey Chaucer</hi> father of our Engliſh Poets by <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, who as it was ſuppoſed gaue him the maner of new Holme in Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire. And <hi>Govver</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Harding</hi> to <hi>Edvvard</hi> the fourth. Alſo how <hi>Frauncis</hi> the Frenche king made <hi>Sangelais, Salmonius, Macrinus,</hi> and <hi>Clement Marot</hi> of his priuy Chamber for their excellent ſkill in vulgare and Latine Poeſie. And king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. her <hi>Maieſties</hi> father for a few Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Engliſh meetre by Sternhold, made him groome of his priuy chamber, &amp; gaue him many other good gifts. And one <hi>Gray</hi> what good eſtimation did he grow vnto with the ſame king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp; afterward with the Duke of Sommerſet Protectour, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king certaine merry Ballades, whereof one chiefly was, <hi>The hunte it vp, the hunte is vp.</hi> And Queene <hi>Mary</hi> his daughter for one <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalamie</hi>

or nuptiall ſong made by <hi>Vargas</hi> a Spaniſh Poet at her mariage with king <hi>Phillip</hi> in Wincheſter gaue him during his life two hundred Crownes penſion: nor this reputation was giuen them in auncient times altogether in reſpect that Poeſie was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate arte, and the Poets them ſelues cunning Princepleaſers, but for that alſo they were thought for their vniuerſall knowledge to be very ſufficient men for the greateſt charges in their common wealthes, were it for counſell or for conduct, whereby no man neede to doubt but that both ſkilles may very well concurre and be moſt excellent in one perſon. For we finde that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> the firſt Emperour and a moſt noble Captaine, was not onely the moſt eloquent Orator of his time, but alſo a very good Poet, though none of his doings therein be now extant. And <hi>Quintus Catulus</hi> a good Poet, and <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> treaſurer of Egipt, and <hi>Horace</hi> the moſt delicate of all the Romain <hi>Lyrickes,</hi> was thought meete and by many letters of great inſtance prouoked to be Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of eſtate to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> th'Emperour, which neuertheleſſe he refuſed for his vnhealthfulneſſe ſake, and being a quiet mynded man and nothing ambitious of glory: <hi>non voluit accedere ad Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicam,</hi> as it is reported. And <hi>Ennius</hi> the Latine Poet was not as ſome perchaunce thinke, onely fauored by <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Africane</hi> for his good making of verſes, but vſed as his familiar and Counſellor in the warres for his great knowledge and amiable conuerſation. And long before that <hi>Antimemdes</hi> and other Greeke Poets, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> reportes in his Politiques, had charge in the warres. And <hi>Firtaeus</hi> the Poet being alſo a lame man &amp; halting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one legge, was choſen by the Oracle of the gods from the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be generall of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> armie, not for his Poetrie, but for his wiſedome and graue perſwaſions, and ſubtile Stratagemes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had the victory ouer his enemies. So as the Poets ſeemed to haue ſkill not onely in the ſubtilties of their arte, but alſo to be meete for all maner of functions ciuill and martiall, euen as they found fauour of the times they liued in, inſomuch as their credit and eſtimation generally was not ſmall. But in theſe dayes (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome learned Princes may take delight in them) yet vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally it is not ſo. For as well Poets as Poeſie are deſpiſed, &amp; the name become, of honorable infamous, ſubiect to ſcorne and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11025:10"/>
and rather a reproch than a prayſe to any that vſeth it: for commonly who ſo is ſtudious in th'Arte or ſhewes him ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in it, they call him in diſdayne a <hi>phantaſticall:</hi> and a light headed or phantaſticall man (by conuerſion) they call a Poet. And this proceedes through the barbarous ignoraunce of the time, and pride of many Gentlemen, and others, whoſe groſſe heads not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought vp or acquainted with any excellent Arte, nor able to contriue, or in manner conceiue any matter of ſubtiltie in any buſineſſe or ſcience, they doe deride and ſcorne it in all others as ſuperfluous knowledges and vayne ſciences, and whatſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe be of rare inuention they terme it <hi>phantaſticall,</hi> conſtruing it to the worſt ſide: and among men ſuch as be modeſt and graue, &amp; of litle conuerſation, nor delighted in the buſie life and vayne ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous actions of the popular, they call him in ſcorne a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> or <hi>Poet,</hi> as much to ſay as a phantaſticall man, very iniuriouſly (God wot) and to the manifeſtation of their own ignoraunce, not making difference betwixt termes. For as the euill and vicious diſpoſition of the braine hinders the ſounde iudgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of man with buſie &amp; diſordered phantaſies, for which cauſe the Greekes call him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo is that part being well affected, not onely nothing diſorderly or confuſed with any monſtruous imaginations or conceits, but very formall, and in his much multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie <hi>vniforme,</hi> that is well proportioned, and ſo paſſing cleare, that by it as by a glaſſe or mirrour, are repreſented vnto the ſoule all maner of bewtifull viſions, whereby the inuentiue parte of the mynde is ſo much holpen, as without it no man could deuiſe any new or rare thing: and where it is not excellent in his kind, there could be no politique Captaine, nor any witty enginer or cunning artificer, nor yet any law maker or counſellor of deepe diſcourſe, yea the Prince of Philoſophers ſtickes not to ſay <hi>animam no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere abſque phantaſmate,</hi> which text to another purpoſe <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Aphrodiſcus</hi> well noteth, as learned men know. And this phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie may be reſembled to a glaſſe as hath bene ſayd, whereof there be many tempers and manner of makinges, as the <hi>perſpectiues</hi> doe acknowledge, for ſome be falſe glaſſes and ſhew thinges otherwiſe than they be in deede, and others right as they be in deede, neither fairer nor fouler, nor greater nor ſmaller. There be againe of theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11025:10"/>
glaſſes that ſhew thinges exceeding faire and comely, others that ſhew figures very monſtruous &amp; illfauored. Euen ſo is the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall part of man (if it be not diſordered) a repreſenter of the beſt, moſt comely and bewtifull images or apparances of thinges to the ſoule and according to their very truth. If otherwiſe, then doth it breede <hi>Chimeres</hi> &amp; monſters in mans imaginations, &amp; not onely in his imaginations, but alſo in all his ordinarie actions and life which enſues. Wherefore ſuch perſons as be illuminated with the brighteſt irradiations of knowledge and of the veritie and due proportion of things, they are called by the learned men not <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtici</hi> but <hi>euphantaſiote,</hi> and of this ſorte of phantaſie are all good Poets, notable Captaines ſtratagematique, all cunning artificers and enginers, all Legiſlators Polititiens &amp; Counſellours of eſtate, in whoſe exerciſes the inuentiue part is moſt employed and is to the ſound &amp; true iudgement of man moſt needful. This diuerſitie in the termes perchance euery man hath not noted, &amp; thus much be ſaid in defence of the Poets honour, to the end no noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous minde be diſcomforted in the ſtudie thereof, the rather for that worthy &amp; honorable memoriall of that noble woman twiſe French Queene, Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of Britaine, wife firſt to king <hi>Charles</hi> the viij. and after to <hi>Lewes</hi> the xij. who paſſing one day from her lodging toward the kinges ſide, ſaw in a gallerie <hi>Maiſter Allame Chartier</hi> the kings Secretarie, an excellent maker or Poet leaning on a tables end a ſleepe, &amp; ſtooped downe to kiſſe him, ſaying thus in all their hearings, we may not of Princely courteſie paſſe by and not honor with our kiſſe the mouth from whence ſo many ſweete ditties &amp; golden poems haue iſſued. But me thinks at theſe words I heare ſome ſmilingly ſay, I would be loath to lacke liuing of my own till the Prince gaue me a maner of new Elme for my riming. And another to ſay I haue read that the Lady <hi>Cynthia</hi> came once downe out of her skye to kiſſe the faire yong lad <hi>Endimion</hi> as he lay a ſleep: &amp; many noble Queenes that haue beſtowed kiſſes vpon their Princes paramours, but neuer vpon any Poets. The third me thinks ſhruggingly ſaith, I kept not to ſit ſleeping with my Poeſie till a Queene came and kiſſed me. But what of all this? Princes may giue a good Poet ſuch conuenient countenaunce and alſo benefite as are due to an excellent artificer, though they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11025:11"/>
kiſſe nor cokes them, and the diſcret Poet lookes for no ſuch extraordinarie fauours, and aſwell doth he honour by his pen the iuſt, liberall, or magnanimous Prince, as the valiaunt, amiable or bewtifull though they be euery one of them the good giftes of God. So it ſeemes not altogether the ſcorne and ordinarie diſgrace offered vnto Poets at theſe dayes, is cauſe why few Gentlemen do delight in the Art, but for that liberalitie, is come to fayle in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who for their largeſſe were wont to be accompted th'onely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of learning, and firſt founders of all excellent artificers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is not perceiued, that Princes them ſelues do take any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this ſcience, by whoſe example the ſubiect is commonly led, and allured to all delights and exerciſes be they good or bad, according to the graue ſaying of the hiſtorian. <hi>Rex multitudinem religione impleuit, quae ſemper regenti ſimilis eſt.</hi> And peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture in this iron &amp; malitious age of ours, Princes are leſſe delighted in it, being ouer earneſtly bent and affected to the affaires of Empire &amp; ambition, whereby they are as it were inforced to indeuour them ſelues to armes and practiſes of hoſtilitie, or to entend to the right pollicing of their ſtates, and haue not one houre to beſtow vpon any other ciuill or delectable Art of naturall or morall doctrine: nor ſcarce any leiſure to thincke one good thought in perfect and godly contemplation, whereby their troubled mindes might be moderated and brought to tranquillitie. So as, it is hard to find in theſe dayes of nobleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or gentlemen any good <hi>Mathematicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or excellent <hi>Muſitian,</hi> or notable <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> or els a cunning Poet: becauſe we find few great Princes much delighted in the ſame ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Now alſo of ſuch among the Nobilitie or gentrie as be very well ſeene in many laudable ſciences, and eſpecially in making or Poeſie, it is ſo come to paſſe that they haue no courage to write &amp; if they haue, yet are they loath to be a knowen of their skill. So as I know very many notable Gentlemen in the Court that haue written commendably, and ſuppreſſed it agayne, or els ſuffred it to be publiſht without their owne names to it: as if it were a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for a Gentleman, to ſeeme learned, and to ſhew himſelfe amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of any good Art. In other ages it was not ſo, for we read that Kinges &amp; Princes haue written great volumes and publiſht them vnder their owne regall titles. As to begin with <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſeſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11025:11"/>
of Kings, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> the greateſt of Emperours, <hi>Hermes Treſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus</hi> the holieſt of Prieſtes and Prophetes, <hi>Euax</hi> king of <hi>Arabia</hi> wrote a booke of precious ſtones in verſe, Prince <hi>Auicenna</hi> of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke and Philoſophie, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> a king of Spaine his Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tables, <hi>Almanſor</hi> a king of <hi>Marrocco</hi> diuerſe Philoſophicall workes, and by their regall example our late ſoueraigne Lord king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight wrate a booke in defence of his faith, then perſwaded that it was the true and Apoſtolicall doctrine, though it hath appeared otherwiſe ſince, yet his honour and learned zeale was nothing leſſe to be allowed. Queenes alſo haue bene knowen ſtudious, and to write large volumes, as Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> of Fraunce Queene of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in our time. But of all others the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo well learned in Muſique and Poeſie, as when he was taken by order of the Senate and appointed to dye, he offered violence to him ſelfe and ſayd, <hi>O quantus artiſex pereo!</hi> as much to ſay, as, how is it poſſible a man of ſuch ſcience and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as my ſelfe, ſhould come to this ſhamefull death?

               </argument>
               <p>VVHerefore the Nobilitie and dignitie of the Art conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aſwell by vniuerſalitie as antiquitie and the naturall excellence of it ſelfe, Poeſie ought not to be abaſed and imployed vpon any vnworthy matter &amp; ſubiect, nor vſed to vaine purpoſes, which neuertheleſſe is dayly ſeene, and that is to vtter conceits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous &amp; vicious or ridiculous and fooliſh, or of no good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; doctrine. Albeit in merry matters (not vnhoneſt) being vſed for mans ſolace and recreation it may be well allowed, for as I ſaid before, Poeſie is a pleaſant maner of vtteraunce varying from the ordinarie of purpoſe to refreſh the mynde by the eares delight. Poeſie alſo is not onely laudable, becauſe I ſaid it was a metricall ſpeach vſed by the firſt men, but becauſe it is a metricall ſpeach corrected and reformed by diſcreet iudgements, and with no leſſe cunning and curioſitie then the Greeke and Latine Poeſie, and by Art bewtified &amp; adorned, &amp; brought far from the primitiue rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the firſt inuentors, otherwiſe it might be ſayd to me that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eues</hi> apernes were the gayeſt garmentes, becauſe they were the firſt, and the ſhepheardes tente or pauillion, the beſt hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, becauſe it was the moſt auncient &amp; moſt vniuerſall: which I would not haue ſo taken, for it is not my meaning but that Art &amp; cunning concurring with nature, antiquitie &amp; vniuerſalitie, in things indifferent, and not euill, doe make them more laudable. And right ſo our vulgar riming Poeſie, being by good wittes brought to that perfection we ſee, is worthily to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other maner of vtterance in proſe, for ſuch vſe and to ſuch purpoſe as it is ordained, and ſhall hereafter be ſet downe more particularly.</p>

               <p>HAuing ſufficiently ſayd of the dignitie of Poets and Poeſie, now it is tyme to ſpeake of the matter or ſubiect of Poeſie, which to myne intent is, what ſoeuer wittie and delicate conceit of man meet or worthy to be put in written verſe, for any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vſe of the preſent time, or good inſtruction of the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

But the chief and principall is: the laud honour &amp; glory of the immortall gods (I ſpeake now in phraſe of the Gentiles.) Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the worthy geſts of noble Princes: the memoriall and regiſtry of all great fortunes, the praiſe of vertue &amp; reproofe of vice, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of morall doctrines, the reuealing of ſciences naturall &amp; other profitable Arts, the redreſſe of boiſtrous &amp; ſturdie courages by perſwaſion, the conſolation and repoſe of temperate myndes, finally the common ſolace of mankind in all his trauails and cares of this tranſitorie life.

               </argument>
               <p>AS the matter of Poeſie is diuers, ſo was the forme of their poemes &amp; maner of writing, for all of them wrote not in one ſort, euen as all of them wrote not vpon one matter. Neither was euery Poet alike cunning in all as in ſome one kinde of Poeſie, nor vttered with like felicitie. But wherein any one moſt excelled, thereof he tooke a ſurname, as to be called a Poet <hi>Heroick, Lyrick, Elegiack, Epigra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matiſt</hi> or otherwiſe. Such therefore as gaue them ſelues to write long hiſtories of the noble geſts of kings &amp; great Princes entermedling the dealings of the gods, halfe gods or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> of the gentiles, &amp; the great &amp; waighty conſequences of peace and warre, they called Poets <hi>Heroick,</hi> whereof <hi>Homer</hi> was chief and moſt auncient among the Greeks, <hi>Virgill</hi> among the Latines:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11025:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Others who more delighted to write ſongs or ballads of pleaſure, to be ſong with the voice, and to the harpe, lute, or citheron &amp; ſuch other muſical, inſtruments, they were called melodious Poets <hi>[me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lici]</hi> or by a more common name <hi>Lirique</hi> Poets, of which ſort was <hi>Pindarus, Anacreon</hi> and <hi>Callimachus</hi> with others among the Greeks: <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> among the Latines.

There was another kind of poeme, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to make ſport, &amp; to refreſh the company with a maner of buffonry or counterfaiting of merry ſpeaches, conuerting all that which they had hard ſpoken before, to a certaine deriſion by a quite contrary ſence, and this was done, when <hi>Comedies</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies</hi> were a playing, &amp; that betweene the actes when the players went to make ready for another, there was great ſilence, and the people waxt weary, then came in theſe maner of conterfaite vices, they were called <hi>Pantomimi,</hi> and all that had before bene ſayd, or great part of it, they gaue a croſſe conſtruction to it very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly.

               <argument>
                  <p>In what forme of Poeſie the gods of the Gentiles were prayſed and honored.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe gods of the Gentiles were honoured by their Poetes in hymnes, which is an extraordinarie and diuine praiſe, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and magnifying them for their great powers and excellence of nature in the higheſt degree of laude, and yet therein their Poets were after a ſort reſtrained: ſo as they could not with their credit vntruly praiſe their owne gods, or vſe in their lauds any maner of groſſe adulation or vnueritable report. For in any writer vntruth and flatterie are counted moſt great reproches. Wherfore to praiſe the gods of the Gentiles, for that by authoritie of their owne fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous records, they had fathers and mothers, and kinred and allies, and wiues and concubines: the Poets firſt commended them by their genealogies or pedegrees, their mariages and aliances, their notable exploits in the world for the behoofe of mankind, and yet as I ſayd before, none otherwiſe then the truth of their owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials might beare, and in ſuch ſort as it might be well auouched by their old written reports, though in very deede they were not from the beginning all hiſtorically true, and many of them verie fictions, and ſuch of them as were true, were grounded vpon ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11025:14"/>
part of an hiſtorie or matter of veritie, the reſt altogether figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue &amp; miſticall, couertly applied to ſome morall or natural ſenſe, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſetteth it foorth in his bookes <hi>de natura deorum.</hi> For to ſay that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was ſonne to <hi>Saturne,</hi> and that he maried his owne ſiſter <hi>Iuno,</hi> might be true, for ſuch was the guiſe of all great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Orientall part of the world both at thoſe dayes and now is. Againe that he loued <hi>Danae, Europa, Leda, Caliſto</hi> &amp; other faire Ladies daughters to kings, beſides many meaner women, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, becauſe he was reported to be a very incontinent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and giuen ouer to his luſtes, as are for the moſt part all the greateſt Princes, but that he ſhould be the higheſt god in heauen, or that he ſhould thunder and lighten, and do manie other things very vnnaturally and abſurdly: alſo that <hi>Saturnus</hi> ſhould geld his father <hi>Celius,</hi> to th'intent to make him vnable to get any moe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and other ſuch matters as are reported by them, it ſeemeth to be ſome wittie deuiſe and fiction made for a purpoſe, or a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and impudent lye, which could not be reaſonably ſuſpected by the Poets, who were otherwiſe diſcreete and graue men, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of wiſedome to others. Therefore either to tranſgreſſe the rules of their primitiue records, or to ſeeke to giue their gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by belying them (otherwiſe then in that ſence which I haue alledged) had bene a ſigne not onely of an vnskilfull Poet, but alſo of a very impudent and leude man. For vntrue praiſe neuer giueth any true reputation. But with vs Chriſtians, who be better diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, and do acknowledge but one God Almightie, euerlaſting, and in euery reſpect ſelfe ſuffizant <hi>[autharcos]</hi> repoſed in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſt &amp; ſoueraigne bliſſe, not needing or exacting any forreine helpe or good. To him we can not exhibit ouermuch praiſe, nor belye him any wayes, vnleſſe it be in abaſing his excellencie by ſcarſitie of praiſe, or by miſconceauing his diuine nature, weening to praiſe him, if we impute to him ſuch vaine delights and peeuiſh affections, as commonly the fraileſt men are reproued for. Namely to make him ambitious of honour, iealous and difficult in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, terrible, angrie, vindicatiue, a louer, a hater, a pitier, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent of mans worſhips: finally ſo paſſionate as in effect he ſhold be altogether <hi>Anthropopathis.</hi> To the gods of the Gentiles they might well attribute theſe infirmities, for they were but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11025:14"/>
of men, great Princes and famous in the world, and not for any other reſpect diuine, then by ſome reſemblance of vertue they had to do good, and to benefite many. So as to the God of the Chriſtians, ſuch diuine praiſe might be verified: to th'other gods none, but figuratiuely or in miſticall ſenſe as hath bene ſaid. In which ſort the ancient Poets did in deede giue them great honors &amp; praiſes, and made to them ſacrifices, &amp; offred them oblations of ſundry ſortes, euen as the people were taught and perſwaded by ſuch placations and worſhips to receaue any helpe, comfort or benefite to them ſelues, their wiues, children, poſſeſſions or goods. For if that opinion were not, who would acknowledge any God? the verie <hi>Etimologie</hi> of the name with vs of the North partes of the world declaring plainely the nature of the attribute, which is all one as if we ſayd good, <hi>[bonus]</hi> or a giuer of good things. Therfore the Gentiles prayed for peace to the goddeſſe <hi>Pallas:</hi> for warre (ſuch as thriued by it) to the god <hi>Mars:</hi> for honor and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the god <hi>Iupiter:</hi> for riches &amp; wealth to <hi>Pluto:</hi> for eloquence and gayne to <hi>Mercurie:</hi> for ſafe nauigation to <hi>Neptune:</hi> for faire weather and proſperous windes to <hi>Eolus:</hi> for skill in muſick and leechcraft to <hi>Apollo:</hi> for free life &amp; chaſtitie to <hi>Diana:</hi> for bewtie and good grace, as alſo for iſſue &amp; proſperitie in loue to <hi>Venus:</hi> for plenty of crop and corne to <hi>Ceres:</hi> for ſeaſonable vintage to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:</hi> and for other things to others. So many things as they could imagine good and deſirable, and to ſo many gods as they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be authors thereof, in ſo much as <hi>Fortune</hi> was made a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, &amp; the feuer quartaine had her aulters, ſuch blindnes &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance raigned in the harts of men at that time, and whereof it firſt proceeded and grew, beſides th'opinion hath bene giuen, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more at large in our bookes of <hi>Ierotekni,</hi> the matter being of another conſideration then to be treated of in this worke. And theſe hymnes to the gods was the firſt forme of Poeſie and the higheſt &amp; the ſtatelieſt, &amp; they were ſong by the Poets as prieſts, and by the people or whole congregation as we ſing in our Churchs the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> but they did it commonly in ſome ſhadie groues of tall tymber trees: In which places they reared aulters of greene turfe, and beſtrewed them all ouer with flowers, and vpon them offred their oblations and made their bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11025:15"/>
(for no kinde of gift can be dearer then life) of ſuch quick cattaille, as euery god was in their conceit moſt delighted in, or in ſome other reſpect moſt fit for the miſterie: temples or churches or other chappels then theſe they had none at thoſe dayes.</p>

                  <p>In what forme of Poeſie vice and the common abuſes of mans life was reprehended.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme perchance would thinke that next after the praiſe and honoring of their gods, ſhould commence the worſhippings and praiſe of good men, and ſpecially of great Princes and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the earth in ſoueraignety and function next vnto the gods. But it is not ſo, for before that came to paſſe, the Poets or holy Prieſts, chiefly ſtudied the rebuke of vice, and to carpe at the common abuſes, ſuch as were moſt offenſiue to the publique and priuate, for as yet for lacke of good ciuility and wholeſome doctrines, there was greater ſtore of lewde lourdaines then of wiſe and learned Lords, or of noble and vertuous Princes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. So as next after the honours exhibited to their gods, the Poets finding in man generally much to reproue &amp; litle to praiſe, made certaine poems in plaine meetres, more like to ſermons or preachings then otherwiſe, and when the people were aſſembled togither in thoſe hallowed places dedicate to their gods, becauſe they had yet no large halles or places of conuenticle, nor had any other correction of their faults, but ſuch as reſted onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of wiſe and graue men, ſuch as at theſe dayes make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſhamed rather then afeard, the ſaid auncient Poets vſed for that purpoſe, three kinds of poems reprehenſiue, to wit, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,</hi> the <hi>Comedie,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Tragedie:</hi> and the firſt and moſt bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiue againſt vice and vicious men, was the <hi>Satyre:</hi> which to th'intent their bitterneſſe ſhould breede none ill will, either to the Poets, or to the recitours, (which could not haue bene choſen if they had bene openly knowen) and beſides to make their admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and reproofs ſeeme grauer and of more efficacie, they made wiſe as if the gods of the woods, whom they called <hi>Satyres</hi> or <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanes,</hi> ſhould appeare and recite thoſe verſes of rebuke, whereas in deede they were but diſguiſed perſons vnder the ſhape of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How vice was afterward reproued by two other maner of poems, better reformed then the Satyre, whereof the firſt was Comedy, the ſecond Tragedie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BVt when theſe maner of ſolitary ſpeaches and recitals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, vttered by the rurall gods out of buſhes and briers, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to the finer heads ſufficiently perſwaſiue, nor ſo popular as if it were reduced into action of many perſons, or by many voyces liuely repreſented to the eare and eye, ſo as a man might thinke it were euen now a doing. The Poets deuiſed to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts played at once by two or three or foure perſons, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the matters of the world, ſometimes of their owne priuate affaires, ſometimes of their neighbours, but neuer medling with any Princes matters nor ſuch high perſonages, but commonly of marchants, ſouldiers, artificers, good honeſt houſholders, and alſo of vnthrifty youthes, yong damſels, old nurſes, bawds, brokers, ruffians and paraſites, with ſuch like, in whoſe behauiors, lyeth in effect the whole courſe and trade of mans life, and therefore ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded altogither to the good amendment of man by diſcipline and example. It was alſo much for the ſolace &amp; recreation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people by reaſon of the pageants and ſhewes. And this kind of poeme was called <hi>Comedy,</hi> and followed next after the <hi>Satyre,</hi> &amp; by that occaſion was ſomwhat ſharpe and bitter after the nature of the <hi>Satyre,</hi> openly &amp; by expreſſe names taxing men more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly and impudently then became, ſo as they were enforced for feare of quarell &amp; blame to diſguiſe their players with ſtrange apparell, and by colouring their faces and carying hatts &amp; capps of diuerſe faſhions to make them ſelues leſſe knowen. But as time &amp; experience do reforme euery thing that is amiſſe, ſo this bitter poeme called the old <hi>Comedy,</hi> being diſuſed and taken away, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11025:16"/>
new <hi>Comedy</hi> came in place, more ciuill and pleaſant a great deale and not touching any man by name, but in a certaine generalitie glancing at euery abuſe, ſo as from thenceforth fearing none ill-will or enmitie at any bodies hands, they left aſide their diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings &amp; played bare face, till one <hi>Roſcius Gallus</hi> the moſt excellent player among the Romaines brought vp theſe vizards, which we ſee at this day vſed, partly to ſupply the want of players, when there were moe parts then there were perſons, or that it was not thought meet to trouble &amp; peſter princes chambers with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny folkes. Now by the chaunge of a vizard one man might play the king and the carter, the old nurſe &amp; the yong damſell, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant &amp; the ſouldier or any other part he liſted very conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There be that ſay <hi>Roſcius</hi> did it for another purpoſe, for being him ſelfe the beſt <hi>Hiſtrien</hi> or buffon that was in his dayes to be found, inſomuch as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid <hi>Roſcius</hi> contended with him by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of liuely geſtures to ſurmount the copy of his ſpeach, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſquint eyed and had a very vnpleaſant countenance, and lookes which made him ridiculous or rather odious to the preſence, he deuiſed theſe vizards to hide his owne ilfauored face.

               </argument>
               <p>BVt becauſe in thoſe dayes when the Poets firſt taxed by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre</hi> and <hi>Comedy,</hi> there was no great ſtore of Kings or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors or ſuch high eſtats (al men being yet for the moſt part rude, &amp; in a maner popularly egall) they could not ſay of them or of their behauiours any thing to the purpoſe, which caſes of Princes are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens taken for the higheſt and greateſt matters of all. But after that ſome men among the moe became mighty and famous in the world, ſoueraignetie and dominion hauing learned them all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of luſts and licentiouſnes of life, by which occaſions alſo their high eſtates and felicities fell many times into moſt lowe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable fortunes: whereas before in their great proſperities they were both feared and reuerenced in the higheſt degree, after their deathes when the poſteritie ſtood no more in dread of them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11025:16"/>
their infamous life and tyrannies were layd open to all the world, their wickednes reproched, their follies and extreme inſolencies derided, and their miſerable ends painted out in playes and page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to ſhew the mutabilitie of fortune, and the iuſt puniſhment of God in reuenge of a vicious and euill life. Theſe matters were alſo handled by the Poets and repreſented by action as that of the <hi>Comedies:</hi> but becauſe the matter was higher then that of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi> the Poets ſtile was alſo higher and more loftie, the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion greater, the place more magnificent: for which purpoſe alſo the players garments were made more rich &amp; coſtly and ſolemne, and euery other thing apperteining, according to that rate: So as where the <hi>Satyre</hi> was pronounced by ruſticall and naked <hi>Syluanes</hi> ſpeaking out of a buſh, &amp; the common players of interludes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Plampedes,</hi> played barefoote vpon the floore: the later <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> vpon ſcaffolds, and by men well and cleanely hoſed and ſhod. Theſe matters of great Princes were played vpon lofty ſtages, &amp; the actors thereof ware vpon their legges buskins of leather cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cothurni,</hi> and other ſolemne habits, &amp; for a ſpeciall prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence did walke vpon thoſe high corked ſhoes or pantofles, which now they call in Spaine &amp; Italy <hi>Shoppini.</hi> And becauſe thoſe buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins and high ſhoes were commonly made of goats skinnes very finely tanned, and dyed into colours: or for that as ſome ſay the beſt players reward, was a goate to be giuen him, or for that as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, a goate was the peculiar ſacrifice to the god <hi>Pan,</hi> king of all the gods of the woodes: foraſmuch as a goate in Greeke is called <hi>Tragos,</hi> therfore theſe ſtately playes were called <hi>Tragedies.</hi> And thus haue ye foure ſundry formes of Poeſie <hi>Dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matick</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiue, &amp; put in execution by the feate &amp; dexteritie of mans body, to wit, the <hi>Satyre,</hi> old <hi>Comedie,</hi> new <hi>Comedie,</hi> and <hi>Tragedie,</hi> whereas all other kinde of poems except <hi>Eglogue</hi> whereof ſhalbe entreated hereafter, were onely recited by mouth or ſong with the voyce to ſome melodious inſtrument.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BVt as the bad and illawdable parts of all eſtates and degrees were taxed by the Poets in one ſort or an other, and thoſe of

great Princes by Tragedie in eſpecial, (&amp; not till after their deaths) as hath bene before remembred, to th'intent that ſuch exemplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) of their blames and aduerſities, being now dead, might worke for a ſecret reprehenſion to others that were aliue, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the ſame or like abuſes. So was it great reaſon that all good and vertuous perſons ſhould for their well doings be rewarded with commendation, and the great Princes aboue all others with honors and praiſes, being for many reſpects of greater moment, to haue them good &amp; vertuous then any inferior ſort of men. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poets being in deede the trumpetters of all praiſe and alſo of ſlaunder (not ſlaunder, but well deſerued reproch) were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience &amp; credit bound next after the diuine praiſes of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall gods, to yeeld a like ratable honour to all ſuch amongſt men, as moſt reſembled the gods by excellence of function, and had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine affinitie with them, by more then humane and ordinarie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhewed in their actions here vpon earth.

This maner of ſtage in halfe circle, the Greekes called <hi>theatrum,</hi> as much to ſay as a beholding place, which was alſo in ſuch ſort contriued by benches and greeces to ſtand or ſit vpon, as no man ſhould empeach anothers ſight.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Shepheards or paſtorall Poeſie called Eglogue, and to vvhat purpoſe it vvas firſt inuented and vſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme be of opinion, and the chiefe of thoſe who haue written in this Art among the Latines, that the paſtorall Poeſie which we commonly call by the name of <hi>Eglogue</hi> and <hi>Bucolick,</hi> a tearme brought in by the Sicilian Poets, ſhould be the firſt of any other, and before the <hi>Satyre</hi> comedie or tragedie, becauſe, ſay they, the ſhepheards and haywards aſſemblies &amp; meetings when they kept their cattell and heards in the common fields and foreſts, was the firſt familiar conuerſation, and their babble and talk vnder buſhes and ſhadie trees, the firſt diſputation and contentious reaſoning, and their fleſhly heates growing of eaſe, the firſt idle wooings, and their ſongs made to their mates or paramours either vpon ſorrow or iolity of courage, the firſt amorous muſicks, ſometime alſo they ſang and played on their pipes for wagers, ſtriuing who ſhould get the beſt game, and be counted cunningeſt. All this I do agree vnto, for no doubt the ſhepheards life was the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of honeſt felowſhip, their trade the firſt art of lawfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition or purchaſe, for at thoſe daies robbery was a manner of purchaſe. So ſaith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his bookes of the Politiques, and that paſturage was before tillage, or fiſhing or fowling, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther predatory art or cheuiſance. And all this may be true, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a ſhepheard keeper of his owne, or of ſome other bodies flocke, there was none owner in the world, quick cattel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt property of any forreine poſſeſſion. I ſay forreine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alway men claimed property in their apparell and armour, and other like things made by their owne trauel and induſtry, nor thereby was there yet any good towne or city or Kings palace, where pageants and pompes might be ſhewed by Comedies or Tragedies. But for all this, I do deny that the <hi>Eglogue</hi> ſhould be the firſt and moſt auncient forme of artificiall Poeſie, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Poet deuiſed the <hi>Eglogue</hi> long after the other <hi>drammatick</hi> poems, not of purpoſe to counterfait or repreſent the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11025:18"/>
ruſticall manner of loues and communication: but vnder the vaile of homely perſons, and in rude ſpeeches to inſinuate and glaunce at greater matters, and ſuch as perchance had not bene ſafe to haue beene diſcloſed in any other ſort, which may be perceiued by the Eglogues of <hi>Virgill,</hi> in which are treated by figure matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance then the loues of <hi>Titirus</hi> and <hi>Corydon.</hi> Theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glogues came after to containe and enforme morall diſcipline, for the amendment of mans behauiour, as be thoſe of <hi>Mantuan</hi> and other moderne Poets.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of historicall Poeſie, by which the famous acts of Princes and the vertuous and worthy liues of our forefathers were reported.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is nothing in man of all the potential parts of his mind (reaſon and will except) more noble or more neceſſary to the actiue life the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> memory: becauſe it maketh moſt to a ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfect worldly wiſedome, examining and comparing the times paſt with the preſent, and by them both conſidering the time to come, concludeth with a ſtedfaſt reſolution, what is the beſt courſe to be taken in all his actions and aduices in this world: it came vpon this reaſon, experience to be ſo highly commended in all conſultations of importance, and preferred before any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ſcience, and yet experience is no more than a maſſe of memories aſſembled, that is, ſuch trials as man hath made in time before. Right ſo no kinde of argument in all the Oratorie craft, doth better perſwade and more vniuerſally ſatisfie then example, which is but the repreſentation of old memories, and like ſucceſſes happened in times paſt. For theſe regards the Poeſie hiſtoricall is of all other next the diuine moſt honorable and worthy, as well for the common benefit as for the ſpeciall comfort euery man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth by it. No one thing in the world with more delectation reuiuing our ſpirits then to behold as it were in a glaſſe the liuely image of our deare forefathers, their noble and vertuous maner of life, with other things autentike, which becauſe we are not able o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to attaine to the knowledge of, by any of our ſences, we apprehend them by memory, whereas the preſent time and things
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11025:19"/>
ſo ſwiftly paſſe away, as they giue vs no leaſure almoſt to looke into them, and much leſſe to know &amp; conſider of them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The things future, being alſo euents very vncertaine, and ſuch as can not poſſibly be knowne becauſe they be not yet, can not be vſed for example nor for delight otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by hope. Though many promiſe the contrary, by vaine and deceitfull arts taking vpon them to reueale the truth of accidents to come, which if it were ſo as they ſurmiſe, are yet but ſciences meerely coniecturall, and not of any benefit to man or to the common wealth, where they be vſed or profeſſed. Therefore the good and exemplarie things and actions of the former ages, were reſerued only to the hiſtoricall reportes of wiſe and graue men: thoſe of the preſent time left to the fruition and iudgement of our ſences: the future as hazards and incertaine euentes vtterly neglected and layd aſide for Magicians and mockers to get their liuings by: ſuch manner of men as by negligence of Magiſtrates and remiſſes of lawes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery countrie breedeth great ſtore of. Theſe hiſtorical men neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe vſed not the matter ſo preciſely to wiſh that al they wrote ſhould be accounted true, for that was not needefull nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the purpoſe, namely to be vſed either for example or for pleaſure: conſidering that many times it is ſeene a fained matter or altogether fabulous, beſides that it maketh more mirth than any other, works no leſſe good concluſions for example then the moſt true and veritable: but often times more, becauſe the Poet hath the handling of them to faſhion at his pleaſure, but not ſo of th'other which muſt go according to their veritie &amp; none otherwiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the writers great blame. Againe as ye know mo and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent examples may be fained in one day by a good wit, then many ages through mans frailtie are able to put in vre, which made the learned and wittie men of thoſe times to deuiſe many hiſtoricall matters of no veritie at all, but with purpoſe to do good and no hurt, as vſing them for a maner of diſcipline and preſident of commendable life. Such was the common wealth of <hi>Plato,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moores Vtopia,</hi> reſting all in deuiſe, but neuer put in execution, and eaſier to be wiſhed then to be performed. And you ſhall perceiue that hiſtories were of three ſortes, wholly true and wholly falſe, and a third holding part of either, but for honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11025:19"/>
and good example they were all of them. And this may be apparant to vs not onely by the Poeticall hiſtories, but alſo by thoſe that be written in proſe: for as <hi>Homer</hi> wrate a fabulous or mixt report of the ſiege of Troy, and another of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes</hi> errors or wandrings, ſo did <hi>Muſeus</hi> compile a true treatiſe of the life &amp; loues of <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Hero,</hi> both of them <hi>Heroick,</hi> and to none ill edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Alſo as <hi>Theucidides</hi> wrate a worthy and veritable hiſtorie, of the warres betwixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and the <hi>Peloponeſes:</hi> ſo did <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi> a moſt graue Philoſopher, and well trained courtier and counſellour make another (but fained and vntrue) of the childhood of <hi>Cyrus</hi> king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> neuertheles both to one effect, that is for example and good information of the poſteritie. Now becauſe the actions of meane &amp; baſe perſonages, tend in very few caſes to any great good example: for who paſſeth to follow the ſteps, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life of a craftes man, ſhepheard or ſailer, though he were his father or deareſt frend? yea how almoſt is it poſſible that ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men ſhould be of any vertue other then their profeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth? Therefore was nothing committed to hiſtorie, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great and excellent perſons &amp; things that the ſame by irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of good courages (ſuch as emulation cauſeth) might worke more effectually, which occaſioned the ſtory writer to chuſe an higher ſtile fit for his ſubiect, the Proſaicke in proſe, the Poet in meetre, and the Poets was by verſe exameter for his grauitie and ſtatelineſſe moſt allowable: neither would they intermingle him with any other ſhorter meaſure, vnleſſe it were in matters of ſuch qualitie, as became beſt to be ſong with the voyce, and to ſome muſicall inſtrument, as were with the Greeks, all your Hymnes &amp; <hi>Encomia</hi> of <hi>Pindarus</hi> &amp; <hi>Callimachus,</hi> not very hiſtories but a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hiſtoricall reportes in which caſes they made thoſe poemes in variable meaſures, &amp; coupled a ſhort verſe with a long to ſerue that purpoſe the better, and we our ſelues who compiled this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe haue written for pleaſure a litle brief <hi>Romance</hi> or hiſtoricall ditty in the Engliſh tong of the Iſle of great <hi>Britaine</hi> in ſhort and long meetres, and by breaches or diuiſions to be more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſong to the harpe in places of aſſembly, where the company ſhalbe deſirous to heare of old aduentures &amp; valiaunces of noble knights in times paſt, as are thoſe of king <hi>Arthur</hi> and his knights

               <argument>
                  <p>In what forme of Poeſie vertue in the inferiour ſort vvas commended.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN euerie degree and ſort of men vertue is commendable, but not egally: not onely becauſe mens eſtates are vnegall, but for that alſo vertue it ſelfe is not in euery reſpect of egall value and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For continence in a king is of greater merit, then in a carter, th'one hauing all oportunities to allure him to luſts, and abilitie to ſerue his appetites, th'other partly, for the baſeneſſe of his eſtate wanting ſuch meanes and occaſions, partly by dread of lawes more inhibited, and not ſo vehemently caried away with vnbridled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and therfore deſerue not in th'one and th'other like praiſe nor equall reward, by the very ordinarie courſe of diſtributiue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Euen ſo parſimonie and illiberalitie are greater vices in a Prince then in a priuate perſon, and puſillanimitie and iniuſtice likewiſe: for to th'one, fortune hath ſupplied inough to maintaine them in the contrarie vertues, I meane, fortitude, iuſtice, liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and magnanimitie: the Prince hauing all plentie to vſe largeſſe by, and no want or neede to driue him to do wrong. Alſo all the aides that may be to lift vp his courage, and to make him ſtout and feareleſſe <hi>(augent animos fortunae)</hi> ſaith the <hi>Mimiſt,</hi> and very truly, for nothing pulleth downe a mans heart ſo much as aduerſitie and lacke. Againe in a meane man prodigalitie and pride are faultes more reprehenſible then in Princes, whoſe high eſtates do require in their countenance, ſpeech &amp; expence, a certaine extraordinary, and their functions enforce them ſometime to exceede the limites of mediocritie not excuſable in a priuat perſon, whoſe manner of life and calling hath no ſuch exigence. Beſides the good and bad of Princes is more exemplarie, and thereby of greater moment then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11025:20"/>
the priuate perſons. Therfore it is that the inferiour perſons, with their inferiour vertues haue a certaine inferiour praiſe, to guerdon their good with, &amp; to comfort them to continue a laudable courſe in the modeſt and honeſt life and behauiour. But this lyeth not in written laudes ſo much as in ordinary reward and commendation to be giuen them by the mouth of the ſuperiour magiſtrate. For hiſtories were not intended to ſo generall and baſe a purpoſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many a meane ſouldier &amp; other obſcure perſons were ſpoken of and made famous in ſtories, as we finde of <hi>Irus</hi> the begger, and <hi>Therſites</hi> the glorious noddie, whom <hi>Homer</hi> maketh mention of. But that happened (&amp; ſo did many like memories of meane men) by reaſon of ſome greater perſonage or matter that it was long of, which therefore could not be an vniuerſall caſe nor chaunce to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery other good and vertuous perſon of the meaner ſort. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Poet in praiſing the maner of life or death of anie meane perſon, did it by ſome litle dittie or Epigram or Epitaph in fewe verſes &amp; meane ſtile conformable to his ſubiect. So haue you how the immortall gods were praiſed by hymnes, the great Princes and heroicke perſonages by ballades of praiſe called <hi>Encomia,</hi> both of them by hiſtoricall reports of great grauitie and maieſtie, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour perſons by other ſlight poemes.</p>

               <p>THe firſt founder of all good affections is honeſt loue, as the mother of all the vicious is hatred.

               </argument>
               <p>PLeaſure is the chiefe parte of mans felicity in this world, and alſo (as our Theologians ſay) in the world to come. Therefore while we may (yea alwaies if it coulde be) to reioyce and take our pleaſures in vertuous and honeſt ſort, it is not only allowable, but alſo neceſſary and very naturall to man. And many be the ioyes and conſolations of the hart: but none greater, than ſuch as he may vtter and diſcouer by ſome conuenient meanes: euen as to ſuppreſſe and hide a mans mirth, and not to haue therein a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or at leaſt wiſe a witnes, is no little griefe and infelicity. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nature and ciuility haue ordained (beſides the priuate ſolaces) publike reioiſings for the comfort and recreation of many. And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11025:21"/>
they be of diuerſe ſorts and vpon diuerſe occaſions growne: one &amp; the chiefe was for the publike peace of a countrie the greateſt of any other ciuill good. And wherein your Maieſtie (my moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne) haue ſhewed your ſelfe to all the world for this one and thirty yeares ſpace of your glorious raigne, aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of Chriſtendome, not onely fortunate, but alſo moſt ſufficient vertuous and worthy of Empire. An other is for iuſt &amp; honourable victory atchieued againſt the forraine enemy. A third at ſolemne feaſts and pompes of coronations and enſtallments of honourable orders. An other for iollity at weddings and marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. An other at the births of Princes children. An other for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate entertainements in Court, or other ſecret diſports in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſuch ſolitary places. And as theſe reioyſings tend to diuers effects, ſo do they alſo carry diuerſe formes and nominations: for thoſe of victorie and peace are called <hi>Triumphall,</hi> whereof we our ſelues haue heretofore giuen ſome example by our <hi>Triumphals</hi> written in honour of her Maieſties long peace. And they were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the auncients in like manner, as we do our generall proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Letanies with bankets and bonefires and all manner of ioyes. Thoſe that were to honour the perſons of great Princes or to ſolemniſe the pompes of any inſtallment were called <hi>Encomia,</hi> we may call them carols of honour. Thoſe to celebrate marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages were called ſongs nuptiall or <hi>Epithalamies,</hi> but in a certaine miſticall ſenſe as ſhall be ſaid hereafter. Others for magnificence at the natiuities of Princes children, or by cuſtome vſed yearely vpon the ſame dayes, are called ſongs natall or <hi>Genethliaca.</hi> Others for ſecret recreation and paſtime in chambers with company or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were the ordinary Muſickes amorous, ſuch as might be ſong with voice or to the Lute, Citheron or Harpe, or daunced by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as the Italian Pauan and galliard are at theſe daies in Princes Courts and other places of honourable or ciuill aſſembly, and of all theſe we will ſpeake in order and very briefly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>LAmenting is altogether contrary to reioiſing, euery man ſaith ſo, and yet is it a peece of ioy to be able to lament with eaſe,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11025:22"/>
and freely to poure forth a mans inward ſorrowes and the greefs wherewith his minde is ſurcharged. This was a very neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the Poet and a fine, beſides his poetrie to play alſo the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, and not onely by applying a medicine to the ordinary ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mankind, but by making the very greef it ſelfe (in part) cure of the diſeaſe. Nowe are the cauſes of mans ſorrowes many: the death of his parents, frends, allies, and children: (though many of the barbarous nations do reioyce at their burials and ſorrow at their birthes) the ouerthrowes and diſcomforts in battell, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions of townes and cities, the deſolations of countreis, the loſſe of goods and worldly promotions, honour and good renowne: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the trauails and torments of loue forlorne or ill beſtowed, either by diſgrace, deniall, delay, and twenty other wayes, that well experienced louers could recite. Such of theſe greefs as might be refrained or holpen by wiſedome, and the parties owne good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, the Poet gaue none order to ſorrow them: for firſt as to the good renowne it is loſt, for the more part by ſome default of the owner, and may be by his well doings recouered againe. And if it be vniuſtly taken away, as by vntrue and famous libels, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders recantation may ſuffiſe for his amends: ſo did the Poet <hi>Steſichorus,</hi> as it is written of him in his <hi>Pallinodie</hi> vpon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe of <hi>Helena,</hi> and recouered his eye ſight. Alſo for worldly goods they come and go, as things not long proprietary to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and are not yet ſubiect vnto fortunes dominion ſo, but that we our ſelues are in great part acceſſarie to our own loſſes and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunces, by ouerſight &amp; miſguiding of our ſelues and our things, therefore why ſhould we bewaile our ſuch voluntary detriment? But death the irrecouerable loſſe, death the dolefull departure of frendes, that can neuer be recontinued by any other meeting or new acquaintance. Beſides our vncertaintie and ſuſpition of their eſtates and welfare in the places of their new abode, ſeemeth to carry a reaſonable pretext of iuſt ſorrow. Likewiſe the great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowes in battell and deſolations of countreys by warres, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the loſſe of many liues and much libertie as for that it toucheth the whole ſtate, and euery priuate man hath his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the damage: Finally for loue, there is no frailtie in fleſh and bloud ſo excuſable as it, no comfort or diſcomfort greater
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11025:22"/>
then the good and bad ſucceſſe thereof, nothing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to man, nothing of more force to vanquiſh his will and to inuegle his iudgement. Therefore of death and burials, of th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities by warres, and of true loue loſt or ill beſtowed, are th'onely ſorrowes that the noble Poets ſought by their arte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue or appeaſe, not with any medicament of a contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as the <hi>Galemſtes</hi> vſe to cure <hi>[contraria contrarijs]</hi> but as the <hi>Paracelſians,</hi> who cure <hi>[ſimilia ſimilibus]</hi> making one dolour to expell another, and in this caſe, one ſhort ſorrowing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of a long and grieuous ſorrow. And the lamenting of deathes was chiefly at the very burialls of the dead, alſo at monethes mindes and longer times, by cuſtome continued yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as they vſed many offices of ſeruice and loue towardes the dead, and thereupon are called <hi>Obſequies</hi> in our vulgare, which was done not onely by cladding the mourners their friendes and ſeruauntes in blacke veſtures, of ſhape dolefull and ſad, but alſo by wofull countenaunces and voyces, and beſides by Poeticall mournings in verſe. Such funerall ſongs were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epicedia</hi> if they were ſong by many, and <hi>Monodia</hi> if they were vttered by one alone, and this was vſed at the enterment of Princes and others of great accompt, and it was reckoned a great ciuilitie to vſe ſuch ceremonies, as at this day is alſo in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey vſed. In Rome they accuſtomed to make orations funerall and commendatorie of the dead parties in the publique place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Procoſtris:</hi> and our <hi>Theologians,</hi> in ſtead thereof vſe to make ſermons, both teaching the people ſome good learning, and alſo ſaying well of the departed. Thoſe ſongs of the dolorous diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in battaile, and other deſolations in warre, or of townes ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caged and ſubuerted, were ſong by the remnant of the army o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen, with great skrikings and outcries, holding the wrong end of their weapon vpwards in ſigne of ſorrow and diſpaire. The cities alſo made generall mournings &amp; offred ſacrifices with Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſongs to appeaſe the wrath of the martiall gods &amp; goddeſſes. The third ſorrowing was of loues, by long lamentation in <hi>Elegie:</hi> ſo was their ſong called, and it was in a pitious maner of meetre, placing a limping <hi>Pentameter,</hi> after a luſty <hi>Exameter,</hi> which made it go dolourouſly more then any other meeter.</p>

               <p>TO returne from ſorrow to reioyſing it is a very good hap and no vnwiſe part for him that can do it, I ſay therefore, that the comfort of iſſue and procreation of children is ſo naturall and ſo great, not onely to all men but ſpecially to Princes, as duetie and ciuilitie haue made it a common cuſtome to reioyſe at the birth of their noble children, and to keepe thoſe dayes hallowed and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuall for euer once in the yeare, during the parentes or childrens liues: and that by publique order &amp; conſent. Of which reioyſings and mirthes the Poet miniſtred the firſt occaſion honorable, by preſenting of ioyfull ſongs and ballades, prayſing the parentes by proofe, the child by hope, the whole kinred by report, &amp; the day it ſelfe with wiſhes of all good ſucceſſe, long life, health &amp; proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for euer to the new borne.

               </argument>
               <p>AS the conſolation of children well begotten is great, no leſſe but rather greater ought to be that which is occaſion of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that is honorable matrimonie, a loue by al lawes allowed, not mutable nor encombred with ſuch vaine cares &amp; paſſions, as that other loue, whereof there is no aſſurance, but looſe and fickle affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction occaſioned for the moſt part by ſodaine ſights and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of no long triall or experience, nor vpon any other good ground wherein any ſuretie may be conceiued: wherefore the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Poet could do no leſſe in conſcience and credit, then as he had before done to the ballade of birth: now with much better deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to celebrate by his poeme the chearefull day of mariages aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Princely as others, for that hath alwayes bene accompted with euery countrey and nation of neuer ſo barbarous people, the higheſt &amp; holieſt, of any ceremonie appertaining to man: a match forſooth made for euer and not for a day, a ſolace prouided for youth, a comfort for age, a knot of alliance &amp; amitie indiſſoluble: great reioyſing was therefore due to ſuch a matter and to ſo glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11025:23"/>
a time. This was done in ballade wiſe as the natall ſong, and was ſong very ſweetely by Muſitians at the chamber dore of the Bridegroome and Bride at ſuch times as ſhalbe hereafter declared and they were called <hi>Epithalamies</hi> as much to ſay as ballades at the bedding of the bride: for ſuch as were ſong at the borde at dinner or ſupper were other Muſickes and not properly <hi>Epithalamies.</hi> Here, if I ſhall ſay that which apperteineth to th'arte, and diſcloſe the miſterie of the whole matter, I muſt and doe with all humble reuerence beſpeake pardon of the chaſte and honorable eares, leaſt I ſhould either offend them with licentious ſpeach, or leaue them ignorant of the ancient guiſe in old times vſed at weddings (in my ſimple opinion) nothing reproueable. This <hi>Epithalamie</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided by breaches into three partes to ſerue for three ſeuerall fits or times to be ſong. The firſt breach was ſong at the firſt parte of the night when the ſpouſe and her husband were brought to their bed &amp; at the very chamber dore, where in a large vtter roome vſed to be (beſides the muſitie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) good ſtore of ladies or ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewomen of their kinſefolkes, &amp; others who came to honor the mariage, &amp; the tunes of the ſongs were very loude and ſhrill, to the intent there might no noiſe be hard out of the bed cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber by the skreeking &amp; outcry of the young damoſell feeling the firſt forces of her ſtiffe &amp; rigorous young man, ſhe being as all virgins tender &amp; weake, &amp; vnexpert in thoſe maner of affaires. For which purpoſe alſo they vſed by old nurſes (appointed to that ſeruice) to ſuppreſſe the noiſe by caſting of pottes full of nuttes round about the chamber vpon the hard floore or paueme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for they vſed no mattes nor ruſhes as we doe now. So as the Ladies and gentlewomen ſhould haue their eares ſo occupied what with Muſicke, and what with their handes wantonly ſcambling and catching after the nuttes, that they could not intend to harken after any other thing. This was as I ſaid to diminiſh the noiſe of the laughing lamenting ſpouſe. The tenour of that part of the ſong was to congratulate the firſt acquaintance and meeting of the young couple, allowing of their parents good diſcretions in making the match, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterward to ſound cherfully to the onſet and firſt encounters of that amorous battaile, to declare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; encreaſe of loue by that meane cheifly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: the bride ſhewing her ſelf euery waies well diſpoſed and ſtill
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11025:24"/>
ſupplying occaſions of new luſtes and loue to her husband, by her obedience and amorous embracings and all other allurementes. About midnight or one of the clocke, the Muſicians came again to the chamber dore (all the Ladies and other women as they were of degree, hauing taken their leaue, and being gone to their reſt.) This part of the ballade was to refreſh the faint and weried bodies and ſpirits, and to animate new appetites with cherefull wordes, encoraging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the recontinuance of the ſame entertainments, praiſing and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (by ſuppoſall) the good conformities of them both, &amp; their deſire one to vanquiſh the other by ſuch fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conflictes: alledging that the firſt embracementes neuer bred barnes, by reaſon of their ouermuch affection and heate, but onely made paſſage for children and enforced greater liking to the late made match. That the ſecond aſſaultes, were leſſe rigorous, but more vigorous and apt to auance the purpoſe of procreation, that therefore they ſhould perſiſt in all good appetite with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible courage to the end. This was the ſecond part of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithalamie.</hi> In the morning when it was faire broad day, &amp; that by liklyhood all tournes were ſufficiently ſerued, the laſt actes of the enterlude being ended, &amp; that the bride muſt within few hours ariſe and apparrell her ſelfe, no more as a virgine, but as a wife, and about dinner time muſt by order come forth <hi>Sicut ſponſade thalamo,</hi> very demurely and ſtately to be ſene and acknowledged of her parents and kinsfolkes whether ſhe were the ſame woman or a changeling, or dead or aliue, or maimed by any accident no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnall. The ſame Muſicians came againe with this laſt part, and greeted them both with a Pſalme of new applauſions, for that they had either of them ſo well behaued them ſelues that night, the husband to rob his ſpouſe of her maidenhead and ſaue her life, the bride ſo luſtely to ſatisfie her husbandes loue and ſcape with ſo litle daunger of her perſon, for which good chaunce that they ſhould make a louely truce and abſtinence of that warre till next night ſealing the placard of that louely league, with twentie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſweet kiſſes, then by good admonitions enformed them to the frugall &amp; thriftie life all the reſt of their dayes. The good man getting and bringing home, the wife ſauing that which her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould get, therewith to be the better able to keepe good

hoſpitalitie, according to their eſtates, and to bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (if God ſent any) vertuouſly, and the better by their owne good example. Finally to perſeuer all the reſt of their life in true and inuiolable wedlocke. This ceremony was omitted when men maried widowes or ſuch as had taſted the frutes of loue before, (we call them well experienced young women) in whom there was no feare of daunger to their perſons, or of any outcry at all, at the time of thoſe terrible approches. Thus much touching the vſage of <hi>Epithalamie</hi> or bedding ballad of the ancient times, in which if there were any wanton or laſciuious matter more then ordinarie which they called <hi>Ficenina lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia</hi> it was borne withal for that time becauſe of the matter no leſſe requiring. <hi>Catullus</hi> hath made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one or two very artificiall and ciuil: but none more excellent then of late yeares a young noble man of Germanie as I take it <hi>Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ſecundus</hi> who in that and in his poeme <hi>Debaſis,</hi> paſſeth any of the auncient or moderne Poetes in my iudgment.</p>

               <p>AN Epitaph is but a kind of Epigram only applied to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the dead perſons eſtate and degree, or of his other good or bad partes, to his commendation or reproch: and is an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch as a man may commodiouſly write or engraue vpon a tombe in few verſes, pithie, quicke and ſententious for the paſſer by to peruſe, and iudge vpon without any long tariaunce: So as if it exceede the meaſure of an Epigram, it is then (if the verſe be correſpondent) rather an Elegie then an Epitaph which errour many of theſe baſtard rimers commit, becauſe they be not learned, nor (as we are wont to ſay) their catftes maſters, for they make long and tedious diſcourſes, and write them in large tables to be hanged vp in Churches and chauncells ouer the tombes of great men and others, which be ſo exceeding long as one muſt haue halfe

               <p>THere be alſo other like Epigrammes that were ſent vſually for new yeares giftes or to be Printed or put vpon their banket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſhes of ſuger plate, or of march paines, &amp; ſuch other dainty meates as by the curteſie &amp; cuſtome euery geſt might carry from a common feaſt home with him to his owne houſe, &amp; were made for the nonce, they were called <hi>Nenia</hi> or <hi>apophoreta,</hi> and neuer contained aboue one verſe, or two at the moſt, but the ſhorter the better, we call them Poſies, and do paint them now a dayes vpon the backe ſides of our fruite trenchers of wood, or vſe them as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes in rings and armes and about ſuch courtly purpoſes. So haue we remembred and ſet forth to your Maieſtie very briefly, all the commended fourmes of the auncient Poeſie, which we in our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare makings do imitate and vſe vnder theſe common names: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude, ſong, ballade, carroll and ditty: borrowing them alſo from the French al ſauing this word (ſong) which is our naturall Saxon Engliſh word. The reſt, ſuch as time and vſurpation by cuſtome haue allowed vs out of the primitiue Greeke &amp; Latine, as Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, Tragedie, Ode, Epitaphe, Elegie, Epigramme, and other moe. And we haue purpoſely omitted all nice or ſcholaſticall curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not meete for your Maieſties contemplation in this our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare arte, and what we haue written of the auncient formes of Poemes, we haue taken from the beſt clerks writing in the ſame arte. The part that next followeth to wit of proportion, becauſe the Greeks nor Latines neuer had it in vſe, nor made any obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more then we doe of their feete, we may truly affirme, to haue bene the firſt deuiſers thereof our ſelues, as <gap reason="foreign">

               <argument>
                  <p>Who in any age haue bene the moſt commended writers in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Poeſie, and the Authors cenſure giuen vpon them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT appeareth by ſundry records of bookes both printed &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that many of our countreymen haue painfully trauelled in this part: of whoſe works ſome appeare to be but bare tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, other ſome matters of their owne inuention and very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereof ſome recitall ſhall be made in this place, to th'intent chiefly that their names ſhould not be defrauded of ſuch honour as ſeemeth due to them for hauing by their thankefull ſtudies ſo much beautified our Engliſh tong (as at this day it will be found our nation is in nothing inferiour to the French or Italian for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of language, ſubtiltie of deuice, good method and proportion in any forme of poeme, but that they may compare with the moſt, and perchance paſſe a great many of them. And I will not reach aboue the time of king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond for any that wrote in Engliſh meeter: becauſe before their times by reaſon of the late Normane conqueſt, which had brought into this Realme much alteration both of our langage and lawes, and there withall a certain martiall barbarouſnes, whereby the ſtudy of all good learning was ſo much decayd, as long time after no man or very few entended to write in any laudable ſcience: ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that time there is litle or nothing worth commendation to be founde written in this arte. And thoſe of the firſt age were <hi>Chaucer</hi> and <hi>Gower</hi> both of them as I ſuppoſe Knightes. After whom followed <hi>Iohn Lydgate</hi> the monke of Bury, &amp; that nameles, who wrote the <hi>Satyre</hi> called Piers Plowman, next him followed <hi>Harding</hi> the Chronicler, then in king <hi>Henry</hi> th'eight times <hi>Skelton,</hi> (I wot not for what great worthines) ſurnamed the Poet <hi>Laureat.</hi> In the latter end of the ſame kings raigne ſpro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vp a new compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of courtly makers, of whom Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> th'elder &amp; <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Earle of Surrey were the two chieftaines, who hauing trauailed into Italie, and there taſted the ſweete and ſtately meaſures and ſtile of the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Poeſie as nouices newly crept out of the ſchooles of <hi>Dante Arioſte</hi> and <hi>Petrarch,</hi> they greatly polliſhed our rude &amp; homely maner of vulgar Poeſie, from that it had bene before, and for that cauſe may iuſtly be ſayd the firſt reformers of our Engliſh
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11025:27"/>
meetre and ſtile. In the ſame time or not long after was the Lord <hi>Nicholas Vaux,</hi> a man of much facilitie in vulgar makings. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in king <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time came to be in reputation for the ſame facultie <hi>Thomas Sternehold,</hi> who firſt tranſlated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh certaine Pſalmes of Dauid, and <hi>Iohn Hoywood</hi> the Epigram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſt who for the myrth and quickneſſe of his conceits more then for any good learning was in him came to be well benefited by the king. But the principall man in this profeſſion at the ſame time was Maiſter <hi>Edward Ferrys</hi> a man of no leſſe mirth &amp; felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that way, but of much more skil, &amp; magnificence in his meeter, and therefore wrate for the moſt part to the ſtage, in Tragedie and ſometimes in Comedie or Enterlude, wherein he gaue the king ſo much good recreation, as he had thereby many good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. In Queenes <hi>Maries</hi> time floriſhed aboue any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Phaer</hi> one that was well learned &amp; excellently well tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Engliſh verſe Heroicall certaine bookes of <hi>Virgils Aenei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi> Since him followed Maiſter <hi>Arthure Golding,</hi> who with no leſſe commendation turned into Engliſh meetre the Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis of <hi>Ouide,</hi> and that other Doctour, who made the ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe bookes of <hi>Virgils Aeneidos,</hi> which Maiſter <hi>Phaer</hi> left vndone. And in her Maieſties time that now is are ſprong vp an other crew of Courtly makers Noble men and Gentlemen of her Maieſties owne ſeruauntes, who haue written excellently well as it would appeare if their doings could be found out and made publicke with the reſt, of which number is firſt that noble Gentleman <hi>Edward</hi> Earle of Oxford. <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord of Bukhurſt, when he was young, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Paget, Sir <hi>Philip Sydney,</hi> Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh,</hi> Maſter <hi>Edward Dyar,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Fulke Greuell, Gaſcon, Britton, Turberuille</hi> and a great many other learned Gentlemen, whoſe names I do not omit for enuie, but to auoyde tediouſneſſe, and who haue deſerued no little commendation. But of them all particularly this is myne opinion, that <hi>Chaucer,</hi> with <hi>Gower, Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> for their antiquitie ought to haue the firſt place, and <hi>Chaucer</hi> as the moſt renowmed of them all, for the much learning appeareth to be in him aboue any of the reſt. And though many of his bookes be but bare tranſlations out of the Latin &amp; French, yet are they wel handled, as his bookes of <hi>Troilus</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:11025:28"/>
and <hi>Creſſeid,</hi> and the Romant of the Roſe, whereof he tranſlated but one halfe, the deuice was <hi>Iohn de Mehunes</hi> a French Poet, the Canterbury tales were <hi>Chaucers</hi> owne inuention as I ſuppoſe, and where he ſheweth more the naturall of his pleaſant wit, then in any other of his workes, his ſimilitudes compariſons and all other deſcriptions are ſuch as can not be amended. His meetre Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call of <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Creſſeid</hi> is very graue and ſtately, keeping the the ſtaffe of ſeuen, and the verſe of ten, his other verſes of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury tales be but riding ryme, neuertheleſſe very well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the matter of that pleaſaunt pilgrimage in which euery mans part is playd with much decency. <hi>Gower</hi> ſauing for his good and graue moralities, had nothing in him highly to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for his verſe was homely and without good meaſure, his wordes ſtrained much deale out of the French writers, his ryme wreſted, and in his inuentions ſmall ſubtillitie: the applications of his moralities are the beſt in him, and yet thoſe many times ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groſſely beſtowed, neither doth the ſubſtance of his workes ſufficiently aunſwere the ſubtilitie of his titles. <hi>Lydgat</hi> a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour onely and no deuiſer of that which he wrate, but one that wrate in good verſe. <hi>Harding</hi> a Poet Epick or Hiſtoricall, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe well according to the time and maner of his ſubiect. He that wrote the Satyr of Piers Ploughman, ſeemed to haue bene a malcontent of that time, and therefore bent himſelfe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to taxe the diſorders of that age, and ſpecially the pride of the Romane Clergy, of whoſe fall he ſeemeth to be a very true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, his verſe is but looſe meetre, and his termes hard and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, ſo as in them is litle pleaſure to be taken. <hi>Skelton</hi> a ſharpe Satiriſt, but with more rayling and ſcoffery then became a Poet Lawreat, ſuch among the Greekes were called <hi>Pantomimi,</hi> with vs Buffons, altogether applying their wits to Scurrillities &amp; other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous matters. <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of Surrey and Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene whom I finde very litle differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I repute them (as before) for the two chief la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ternes of light to all others that haue ſince em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their pennes vpon Engliſh Poeſie, their conceits were lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, their ſtiles ſtately, their conueyance cleanely, their termes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, their meetre ſweete and well proportioned, in all imitating very naturally and ſtudiouſly their Maiſter <hi>Francis Petrarcha.</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:11025:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> his commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyeth chiefly in the facillitie of his meetre, and the aptneſſe of his deſcriptions ſuch as he taketh vpon him to make, namely in ſundry of his Songs, wherein he ſheweth the counterfait actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very liuely &amp; pleaſantly. Of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort I thinke thus. That for Tragedie, the Lord of Buckhurſt, &amp; Maiſter <hi>Edward Ferrys</hi> for ſuch doings as I haue ſene of theirs do deſerue the hyeſt price: Th'Earle of Oxford and Maiſter <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes</hi> of her Maieſties Chappell for Comedy and Enterlude. For Eglogue and paſtorall Poeſie, Sir <hi>Philip Sydney</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenner,</hi> and that other Gentleman who wrate the late ſhepheardes Callender. For dittie and amourous <hi>Ode</hi> I finde Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyghs</hi> vayne moſt loftie, inſolent, and paſſionate. Maiſter <hi>Edward Dyar,</hi> for Elegie moſt ſweete, ſolempne and of high conceit. <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> for a good meeter and for a plentifull vayne. <hi>Phaer</hi> and <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> for a learned and well corrected verſe, ſpecially in tranſlation cleare and very faithfully anſwering their authours intent.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſaid by ſuch as profeſſe the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſciences, that all things ſtand by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and that without it nothing could ſtand to be good or beautiful. The Doctors of our Theologie to the ſame effect, but in other termes, ſay: that God made the world by number, meaſure and weight: ſome for weight ſay tune, and peraduenture better. For weight is a kind of meaſure or of much conueniencie with it: and therefore in their deſcriptions be alwayes coupled together <hi>(ſtatica &amp; metrica)</hi> weight and meaſures. Hereupon it ſeemeth the Philoſopher gathers a triple proportion, to wit, the Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, the Geometricall, and the Muſical. And by one of theſe three is euery other proportion guided of the things that haue conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie by relation, as the viſible by light colour and ſhadow: the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by ſtirres, times and accents: the odorable by ſmelles of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry temperaments: the taſtible by ſauours to the rate: the tangible by his obiectes in this or that regard. Of all which we leaue to ſpeake, returning to our poeticall proportion, which holdeth of the Muſical, becauſe as we ſayd before Poeſie is a skill to ſpeake &amp; write harmonically: and verſes or rime be a kind of Muſicall vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, by reaſon of a certaine congruitie in ſounds pleaſing the eare, though not perchance ſo exquiſitely as the harmonicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of the artificial Muſicke, conſiſting in ſtrained tunes, as is the vocall Muſike, or that of melodious inſtruments, as Lutes, Harpes, Regals, Records and ſuch like. And this our proportion Poeticall

               <argument>
                  <p>Of proportion in Staffe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>STaffe in our vulgare Poeſie I know not why it ſhould be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vnleſſe it be for that we vnderſtand it for a bearer or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of a ſong or ballad, not vnlike the old weake bodie, that is ſtayed vp by his ſtaffe, and were not otherwiſe able to walke or to ſtand vpright. The Italian called it <hi>Stanza,</hi> as if we ſhould ſay a reſting place: and if we conſider well the forme of this Poeticall ſtaffe, we ſhall finde it to be a certaine number of verſes allowed to go altogether and ioyne without any intermiſſion, and doe or ſhould finiſh vp all the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the ſame with a full period, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in ſom ſpecial caſes, &amp; there to ſtay till another ſtaffe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of like ſort: and the ſhorteſt ſtaffe conteineth not vnder foure verſes, nor the longeſt aboue ten, if it paſſe that number it is rather a whole ditty then properly a ſtaffe. Alſo for the more part the ſtaues ſtand rather vpon the euen nomber of verſes then the odde, though there be of both ſorts. The firſt proportion then of a ſtaffe is by <hi>quadrien</hi> or foure verſes. The ſecond of fiue verſes, and is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vſed. The third by <hi>ſizeine</hi> or ſixe verſes, and is not only moſt vſual, but alſo very pleaſant to th'eare. The fourth is in ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verſes, &amp; is the chiefe of our ancient proportions vſed by any rimer wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing of hiſtorical or graue poeme, as ye may ſee in <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and <hi>Lidgate</hi> th'one writing the loues of <hi>Troylus</hi> and <hi>Creſſeida,</hi> th'other of the fall of Princes: both by them tranſlated not deuiſed. The firſt proportion is of eight verſes very ſtately and <hi>Heroicke,</hi> and which I like better then that of ſeuen, becauſe it receaueth better band. The ſixt is of nine verſes, rare but very graue. The ſeuenth proportion is of tenne verſes, very ſtately, but in many mens opinion too long: neuertheleſſe of very good grace &amp; much grauitie. Of eleuen and twelue I find none ordinary ſtaues vſed in any vulgar language, neither doth it ſerue well to continue any hiſtoricall report or ballade, or other ſong: but is a dittie of it ſelf, and no ſtaffe, yet ſome moderne waiters haue vſed it but very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Then laſt of all haue ye a proportion to be vſed in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11025:30"/>
of your ſtaues, as to a caroll and a ballade, to a ſong, &amp; a round, or virelay. For to an hiſtoricall poeme no certain number is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as the matter fals out: alſo a <hi>diſtick</hi> or couple of verſes is not to be accompted a ſtaffe, but ſerues for a continuance as we ſee in Elegie, Epitaph, Epigramme or ſuch meetres, of plaine concord not harmonically entertangled, as ſome other ſongs of more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate muſick be.</p>
               <p>A ſtaffe of foure verſes containeth in it ſelfe matter ſufficient to make a full periode or complement of ſence, though it doe not alwayes ſo, and therefore may go by diuiſions.</p>
               <p>A ſtaffe of fiue verſes, is not much vſed becauſe he that can not comprehend his periode in foure verſes, will rather driue it into ſix then leaue it in fiue, for that the euen number is more agreable to the eare then the odde is.</p>
               <p>A ſtaffe of ſixe verſes, is very pleaſant to the eare, and alſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for a greater complement then the inferiour ſtaues, which maketh him more commonly to be vſed.</p>
               <p>A ſtaffe of ſeuen verſes, moſt vſuall with our auncient makers, alſo the ſtaffe of eight, nine and ten of larger complement then the reſt, are onely vſed by the later makers, &amp; vnleſſe they go with very good bande, do not ſo well as the inferiour ſtaues. Therefore if ye make your ſtaffe of eight, by two fowers not entertangled, it is not a huitaine or a ſtaffe of eight, but two quadreins, ſo is it in ten verſes, not being entertangled they be but two ſtaues of fiue.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MEeter and meaſure is all one, for what the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Latines call <hi>Menſura,</hi> and is but the quantitie of a verſe, either long or ſhort. This quantitie with them conſiſteth in the number of their feete: &amp; with vs in the number of ſillables, which are comprehended in euery verſe, not regarding his feete, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then that we allow in ſcanning our verſe, two ſillables to make one ſhort portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſuppoſe it a foote) in euery verſe. And after that ſort ye may ſay, we haue feete in our vulgare rymes, but that is improperly: for a foote by his ſence naturall is a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of office and function, and ſerueth to three purpoſes, that is to ſay, to go, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11025:31"/>
runne, &amp; to ſtand ſtill ſo: as he muſt be ſometimes ſwift, ſometimes ſlow, ſometime vnegally marching or peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ſteddy. And if our feete Poeticall want theſe qualities it can not be ſayd a foote in ſence tranſlatiue as here. And this commeth to paſſe, by reaſon of the euident motion and ſtirre, which is perceiued in the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our wordes not alwayes egall: for ſome aske longer, ſome ſhorter time to be vttered in, &amp; ſo by the Philoſophers definition, ſtirre is the true meaſure of time. The Greekes &amp; Latines becauſe their wordes hapned to be of many ſillables, and very few of one ſillable, it fell out right with them to conceiue and alſo to perceiue, a notable diuerſitie of motion and times in the pronuntiation of their wordes, and therefore to euery <hi>biſſillable</hi> they allowed two times, &amp; to a <hi>triſſillable</hi> three times, &amp; to euery <hi>poliſillable</hi> more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his quantitie, &amp; their times were ſome long, ſome ſhort according as their motions were ſlow or ſwift. For the ſound of ſome ſillable ſtayd the eare a great while, and others ſlid away ſo quickly, as if they had not bene pronounced, then euery ſillable being allowed one time, either ſhort or long, it fell out that euery <hi>tetraſillable</hi> had foure times, euery <hi>triſſillable</hi> three, and the <hi>biſſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> two, by which obſeruation euery word, not vnder that ſiſe, as he ranne or ſtood in a verſe, was called by them a foote of ſuch and ſo many times, namely the <hi>biſſillable</hi> was either of two long times as the <hi>ſpondeus,</hi> or two ſhort, as the <hi>pirchius,</hi> or of a long &amp; a ſhort as the <hi>trocheus,</hi> or of a ſhort and a long as the <hi>iambus:</hi> the like rule did they ſet vpon the word <hi>triſſillable,</hi> calling him a foote of three times: as the <hi>dactilus</hi> of a long and two ſhort: the <hi>molloſſus</hi> of three long, the <hi>tribracchus</hi> of three ſhort, the <hi>amphibracchus</hi> of two long and a ſhort the <hi>amphimacer</hi> of two ſhort and a long. The word of foure ſillables they called a foote of foure times, ſome or all of them, either long or ſhort: and yet not ſo content they mounted higher, and becauſe their wordes ſerued well thereto, they made feete of ſixe times: but this proceeded more of curioſitie, then otherwiſe: for whatſoeuer foote paſſe the <hi>triſſillable</hi> is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his inferiour as euery number Arithmeticall aboue three, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded of the inferiour numbers as twiſe two make foure, but the three is made of one number, videl. of two and an vnitie.

               <argument>
                  <p>How many ſorts of meaſures we vſe in our vulgar.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO returne from rime to our meaſure againe, it hath bene ſayd that according to the number of the ſillables contained in euery verſe, the ſame is ſayd a long or ſhort meeter, and his ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt proportion is of foure ſillables, and his longeſt of twelue, they that vſe it aboue, paſſe the bounds of good proportion. And euery meeter may be aſwel in the odde as in the euen ſillable, but better in the euen, and one verſe may begin in the euen, &amp; another follow in the odde, and ſo keepe a commendable proportion. The verſe that containeth but two ſilables, which may be in one word, is not vſuall: therefore many do deny him to be a verſe, ſaying that it is but a foot, and that a meeter can haue no leſſe then two feete at the leaſt, but I find it otherwiſe aſwell among the beſt Italian Poets, as alſo with our vulgar makers, and that two ſillables ſerue wel for a ſhort meaſure in the firſt place, and midle, and end of a ſtaffe: and alſo in diuerſe ſcituations and by ſundry diſtances, and is very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and of good grace, as ſhalbe declared more at large in the Chapter of proportion by ſcituation.</p>
               <p>The next meaſure is of two feete or of foure ſillables, and then one word <hi>tetraſillable</hi> diuided in the middeſt makes vp the whole meeter, as thus
<q>
                     <l>Rēuē rēntlīe</l>
                  </q>
Or a triſſillable and one monoſillable thus. <hi>Soueraine God,</hi> or two biſſillables and that is pleſant thus, <hi>Reſtore againe,</hi> or with foure monoſſillables, and that is beſt of all thus, <hi>When I doe thinke,</hi> I finde no ſauour in a meetre of three ſillables nor in effect in any odde, but they may be vſed for varietie ſake, and ſpecially being enterla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with others the meetre of ſix ſillables is very ſweete and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>O God vvhen I behold</l>
                  <l>This bright heauen ſo hye</l>

               </q>
               <p>The meter of ſeuen ſillables is not vſual, no more is that of nine and eleuen, yet if they be well compoſed, that is, their <hi>Ceſure</hi> well appointed, and their laſt accent which makes the concord, they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11025:32"/>
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable inough, as in this ditty where one verſe is of eight an other is of ſeuen, and in the one the accent vpon the laſt, in the other vpon the laſt ſaue on.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The ſmoakie ſighes, the bitter teares</l>
                  <l>That I in vaine haue waſted</l>
                  <l>The broken ſleepes, the woe and feares</l>
                  <l>That long in me haue laſted</l>
                  <l>Will be my death, all by thy guilt</l>
                  <l>And not by my deſeruing</l>
                  <l>Since ſo inconſtantly thou wilt</l>
                  <l>Not loue but ſtill be ſweruing.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And all the reaſon why theſe meeters in all ſillable are alowable is, for that the ſharpe accent falles vpon the <hi>penultima</hi> or laſt ſaue one ſillable of the verſe, which doth ſo drowne the laſt, as he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe away in maner vnpronounced, &amp; ſo make the verſe ſeeme euen: but if the accent fall vpon the laſt and leaue two flat to finiſh the verſe, it will not ſeeme ſo: for the odnes will more notoriouſly appeare, as for example in the laſt verſe before recited <hi>Not loue but ſtill be ſweruing,</hi> ſay thus <hi>Loue it is a maruelous thing.</hi> Both verſes be of egall quantitie, vidz. ſeauen ſillables a peece, and yet the firſt ſeemes ſhorter then the later, who ſhewes a more od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then the former by reaſon of his ſharpe accent which is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laſt ſillable, and makes him more audible then if he had ſlid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a flat accent, as the word <hi>ſwéruing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your ordinarie rimers vſe very much their meaſures in the odde as nine and eleuen, and the ſharpe accent vpon the laſt ſillable, which therefore makes him go ill fauouredly and like a minſtrels muſicke. Thus ſayd one in a meeter of eleuen very harſhly in mine eare, whether it be for lacke of good rime or of good reaſon, or of both I wot not.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This ſort of compotition in the odde I like not, vnleſſe it be holpen by the <hi>Ceſure</hi> or by the accent as I ſayd before.</p>
               <p>The meeter of eight is no leſſe pleaſant then that of ſixe, and

               </q>
               <p>This meeter of twelue ſillables the French man calleth a verſe <hi>Alexandrine,</hi> and is with our moderne rimers moſt vſuall: with the auncient makers it was not ſo. For before Sir <hi>Thomas Wiats</hi> time they were not vſed in our vulgar, they be for graue and ſtately matters fitter than for any other ditty of pleaſure. Some makers write in verſes of foureteene ſillables giuing the <hi>Ceſure</hi> at the firſt eight, which proportion is tedious, for the length of the verſe ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the eare too long from his delight, which is to heare the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or the tuneable accent in the ende of the verſe. Neuertheleſſe that of twelue if his <hi>Ceſure</hi> be iuſt in the middle, and that ye ſuffer him to runne at full length, and do not as the common rimers do, or their Printer for ſparing of paper, cut them of in the middeſt, wherin they make in two verſes but halfe rime. They do very wel as wrote the Earle of Surrey tranſlating the booke of the preacher.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Salomon Dauids ſonne, king of Ieruſalem.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This verſe is a very good <hi>Alexandrine,</hi> but perchaunce woulde haue ſounded more muſically, if the firſt word had bene a diſſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or two monoſillables and not a triſſillable: hauing his ſharpe accent vppon the <hi>Antepenultima</hi> as it hath, by which occaſion it runnes like a <hi>Dactill,</hi> and carries the two later ſillables away ſo ſpeedily as it ſeemes but one foote in our vulgar meaſure, and by that meanes makes the verſe ſeeme but of eleuen ſillables, which odneſſe is nothing pleaſant to the eare. Iudge ſome body whether it would haue done better (if it might) haue bene ſayd thus,
<q>
                     <l>Robóham Dauids ſonne king of Ieruſalem.</l>
                  </q>

                  </q>
For now the ſharpe accent falles vpon <hi>bo,</hi> and ſo doth it vpon the laſt in <hi>reſtóre,</hi> which was not in th'other verſe. But becauſe we haue ſeemed to make mention of <hi>Ceſure,</hi> and to appoint his place in euery meaſure, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſay ſomewhat more of it,

               </argument>
               <p>THere is no greater difference betwixt a ciuill and brutiſh vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraunce then cleare diſtinction of voices: and the moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable languages are alwaies moſt plaine and diſtinct, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous moſt confuſe and indiſtinct: it is therefore requiſit that leaſure be taken in pronuntiation, ſuch as may make our wordes plaine &amp; moſt audible and agreable to the eare: alſo the breath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be now and then releeued with ſome pauſe or ſtay more or leſſe: beſides that the very nature of ſpeach (becauſe it goeth by clauſes of ſeuerall conſtruction &amp; ſence) requireth ſome ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with intermiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſound, to th'end they may not huddle one vpon another ſo rudly &amp; ſo faſt that th'eare may not perceiue their difference. For theſe reſpectes the auncient reformers of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, inuented, three maner of pauſes, one of leſſe leaſure then another, and ſuch ſeuerall intermiſſions of ſound to ſerue (beſides eaſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the breath) for a treble diſtinction of ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces or parts of ſpeach, as they happened to be more or leſſe perfect in ſence. The ſhorteſt pauſe or intermiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they called <hi>comma</hi> as who would ſay a peece of a ſpeach cut of. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they called <hi>colon,</hi> not a peece but as it were a member for his larger length, becauſe it occupied twiſe as much time as the <hi>comma.</hi> The third they called <hi>periodus,</hi> for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement or full pauſe, and as a reſting place and perfection of ſo much former ſpeach as had bene vttered, and from whence they needed not to paſſe any further vnles it were to renew more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enlarge the tale. This cannot be better repreſented then by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trauailers by the hie ways, where they ſeeme to allow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues three maner of ſtaies or eaſements: one a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe calling perchaunce for a cup of beere or wine, and hauing dronken it vp rides away and neuer lights: about noone he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to his Inne, &amp; there baites him ſelfe and his horſe an houre or more: at night when he can conueniently trauaile no further, he taketh vp his lodging, and reſts him ſelfe till the morrow: from whence he followeth the courſe of a further voyage, if his buſineſſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11025:34"/>
be ſuch. Euen ſo our Poet when he hath made one verſe, hath as it were finiſhed one dayes iourney, &amp; the while eaſeth him ſelfe with one baite at the leaſt, which is a <hi>Comma</hi> or <hi>Ceſure</hi> in the mid way, if the verſe be euen and not odde, otherwiſe in ſome other place, and not iuſt in the middle. If there be no <hi>Ceſure</hi> at all, and the verſe long, the leſſe is the makers skill and hearers delight. Therefore in a verſe of twelue ſillables the <hi>Ceſure</hi> ought to fall right vpon the ſixt ſillable: in a verſe of eleuen vpon the ſixt alſo leauing fiue to follow. In a verſe often vpon the fourth, leauing ſixe to follow. In a verſe of nine vpon the fourth, leauing fiue to follow. In a verſe of eight iuſt in the middeſt, that is, vpon the fourth. In a verſe of ſeauen, either vpon the fourth or none at all, the meeter very ill brooking any pauſe. In a verſe of ſixe ſillables and vnder is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full no <hi>Ceſure</hi> at all, becauſe the breath asketh no reliefe: yet if ye giue any <hi>Comma,</hi> it is to make diſtinction of ſenſe more then for any thing elſe: and ſuch <hi>Ceſure</hi> muſt neuer be made in the middeſt of any word, if it be well appointed. So may you ſee that the vſe of theſe pawſes or diſtinctions is not generally with the vulgar Poet as it is with the Proſe writer becauſe the Poetes cheife Muſicke lying in his rime or concorde to heare the Simphonie, he maketh all the haſt he can to be at an end of his verſe, and delights not in many ſtayes by the way, and therefore giueth but one <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> to any verſe: and thus much for the ſounding of a meetre. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he may vſe in any verſe both his <hi>comma, colon,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatiue</hi> point, as well as in proſe. But our auncient rymers, as <hi>Chaucer, Lydgate</hi> &amp; others, vſed theſe <hi>Ceſures</hi> either very ſeldome, or not at all, or elſe very licentiouſly, and many times made their meetres (they called them riding ryme) of ſuch vnſhapely wordes as would allow no conuenient <hi>Ceſure,</hi> and therefore did let their rymes runne out at length, and neuer ſtayd till they came to the end: which maner though it were not to be miſliked in ſome ſort of meetre, yet in euery long verſe the <hi>Ceſure</hi> ought to be kept pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, if it were but to ſerue as a law to correct the licentiouſneſſe of rymers, beſides that it pleaſeth the eare better, &amp; ſheweth more cunning in the maker by following the rule of his reſtraint. For a rymer that will be tyed to no rules at all, but range as he liſt, may eaſily vtter what he will: but ſuch maner of Poeſie is called id our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11025:34"/>
vulgar, ryme dogrell, with which rebuke we will in no caſe our maker ſhould be touched. Therfore before all other things let his ryme and concordes be true, cleare and audible with no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, then almoſt the ſtrayned note of a Muſicians mouth, &amp; not darke or wrenched by wrong writing as many doe to patch vp their meetres, and ſo follow in their arte neither rule, reaſon, nor ryme. Much more might be ſayd for the vſe of your three pauſes, <hi>comma, colon,</hi> &amp; <hi>periode,</hi> for perchance it be not all a matter to vſe many <hi>commas,</hi> and few, nor <hi>colons</hi> likewiſe, or long or ſhort <hi>periodes,</hi> for it is diuerſly vſed, by diuers good writers. But becauſe it apperteineth more to the oratour or writer in proſe then in verſe, I will ſay no more in it, then thus, that they be vſed for a commodious and ſenſible diſtinction of clauſes in proſe, ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery verſe is as it were a clauſe of it ſelfe, and limited with a <hi>Ceſure</hi> howſoeuer the ſence beare, perfect or imperfect, which difference is obſeruable betwixt the proſe and the meeter.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BEcauſe we vſe the word rime (though by maner of abuſion) yet to helpe that fault againe we apply it in our vulgar Poeſie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way very commendably &amp; curiouſly. For wanting the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantneſſe of the Greeke and Latine feete, in ſtead thereof we make in th'ends of our verſes a certaine tunable ſound: which anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with another verſe reaſonably diſtant we accord together in the laſt fall or cadence: the eare taking pleaſure to heare the like tune reported, and to feele his returne. And for this purpoſe ſerue the <hi>monoſillables</hi> of our Engliſh Saxons excellently well, becauſe they do naturally and indifferently receiue any accent, &amp; in them if they finiſh the verſe, reſteth the ſhrill accent of neceſſitie, and ſo doth it not in the laſt of euery <hi>biſſillable,</hi> nor of euery <hi>poliſillable</hi> word: but to the purpoſe, <hi>ryme</hi> is a borrowed word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Greeks by the Latines and French, from them by vs Saxon angles and by abuſion as hath bene ſayd, and therefore it ſhall not do amiſſe to tell what this <hi>rithmos</hi> was with the Greekes, for what is it with vs hath bene already ſayd. There is an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptable number which we call <hi>arithmeticall (arithmos)</hi> as one, two, three. There is alſo a muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

or audible number, faſhioned by ſtirring of tunes &amp; their ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times in the vtterance of our wordes, as when the voice goeth high or low, or ſharpe or flat, or ſwift or ſlow: &amp; this is called <hi>rith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> or numeroſitie, that is to ſay, a certaine flowing vtteraunce by ſlipper words and ſillables ſuch as the toung eaſily vtters, and the eare with pleaſure receiueth, and which flowing of wordes with much volubilitie ſmoothly proceeding from the mouth is in ſome ſort <hi>harmonicall</hi> and breedeth to th'eare a great compaſſion. This point grew by the ſmooth and delicate running of their feete, which we haue not in our vulgare, though we vſe as much as may be the moſt flowing words &amp; ſlippery ſillables, that we can picke out: yet do not we call that by the name of ryme, as the Greekes did: but do giue the name of ryme onely to our concordes, or tunable conſentes in the latter end of our verſes, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes the Greekes nor Latines neuer vſed in their Poeſie till by the barbarous ſouldiers out of the campe, it was brought into the Court and thence to the ſchoole, as hath bene before remembred: and yet the Greekes and Latines both vſed a maner of ſpeach, by clauſes of like termination, which they called <gap reason="foreign">

then another: or ſounded with a higher note &amp; clearer voyce then another, and of neceſſitie this diuerſitie of ſound, muſt fall either vpon the laſt ſillable, or vpon the laſt ſaue one, or vpon the third and could not reach higher to make any notable difference, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to giue vnto three different ſounds, three ſeuerall names: to that which was higheſt lift vp and moſt eleuate or ſhrilleſt in the eare, they gaue the name of the ſharpe accent, to the loweſt and moſt baſe becauſe it ſeemed to fall downe rather then to riſe vp, they gaue the name of the heauy accent, and that other which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in part to lift vp and in part to fall downe, they called the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumflex, or compaſt accent: and if new termes were not odious, we might very properly call him the (windabout) for ſo is the Greek word. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bycauſe euery thing that by nature fals down is ſaid heauy, &amp; whatſoeuer naturally mounts vpward is ſaid light, it gaue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay that there were diuerſities in the motion of the voice, as ſwift &amp; ſlow, which motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo preſuppoſes time, bycauſe time is <hi>menſura motus,</hi> by the Philoſopher: ſo haue you the cauſes of their primitiue inuention and vſe in our arte of Poeſie, all this by good obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may perceiue in our vulgar wordes if they be of mo ſillables the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, but ſpecially if they be <hi>triſſillables,</hi> as for example in theſe wordes <hi>[altitude]</hi> and <hi>[heauineſſe]</hi> the ſharpe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent falles vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>How the good maker will not wrench his word to helpe his rime, either by falſifying his accent, or by vntrue orthographie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw there can not be in a maker a fowler fault, then to falſifie his accent to ſerue his cadence, or by vntrue orthographie to wrench his words to helpe his rime, for it is a ſigne that ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker it not copious in his owne language, or (as they are wont to ſay) not halfe his crafts maiſter: as for example, if one ſhould rime to this word <hi>[Reſtore]</hi> he may not match him with <hi>[Doore]</hi> or <hi>[Poore]</hi> for neither of both are of like terminant, either by good orthography or in naturall ſound, therfore ſuch rime is ſtrained, ſo is it to this word <hi>[Ram]</hi> to ſay <hi>[came]</hi> or to <hi>[Beane [Den]</hi> for they ſound not nor be written a like, &amp; many other like cadences which were ſuperfluous to recite, and are vſuall with rude rimers who obſerue not preciſely the rules of <hi>[proſodie]</hi> neuertheleſſe in all ſuch caſes (if neceſſitie conſtrained) it is ſomewhat more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to help the rime by falſe orthographie, then to leaue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſant diſſonance to the eare, by keeping trewe orthographie and looſing the rime, as for example it is better to rime <hi>[Dore]</hi> with <hi>[Reſtore]</hi> then in his truer orthographie, which is <hi>[Doore]</hi> and to this word <hi>[Deſire]</hi> to ſay <hi>[Fier]</hi> then fyre though it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe better written <hi>fire.</hi> For ſince the cheife grace of our vulgar Poeſie conſiſteth in the Symphonie, as hath bene already ſayd, our maker muſt not be too licentious in his concords, but ſee that they go euen, iuſt and melodious in the eare, and right ſo in the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie or currantneſſe of the whole body of his verſe, and in euery other of his proportions. For a licentious maker is in truth but a bungler and not a Poet. Such men were in effect the moſt part of all your old rimers and ſpecially <hi>Gower,</hi> who to make vp his rime would for the moſt part write his terminant ſillable with falſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographie, and many times not ſticke to put in a plaine French word for an Engliſh, &amp; ſo by your leaue do many of our common rimers at this day: as he that by all likelyhood, hauing no word at hand to rime to this word <hi>[ioy]</hi> he made his other verſe ende in <hi>[Roy]</hi> ſaying very impudently thus,

Which word was neuer yet receiued in our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage for an Engliſh word.

as I ſayd before, like as the Symphonie in a verſe of great length, is (as it were) loſt by looking after him, and yet may the meetre be very graue and ſtately: ſo on the other ſide doth the ouer buſie and too ſpeedy returne of one maner of tune, too much annoy &amp; as it were glut the eare, vnleſſe it be in ſmall &amp; popular Muſickes ſong by theſe <hi>Cantabanqui</hi> vpon benches and barrels heads where they haue none other audience then boys or countrey fellowes that paſſe by them in the ſtreete, or elſe by blind harpers or ſuch like tauerne minſtrels that giue a fit of mirth for a groat, &amp; their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being for the moſt part ſtories of old time, as the tale of Sir <hi>Topas,</hi> the reportes of <hi>Beuis</hi> of <hi>Southampton, Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwicke, Adam Bell,</hi> and <hi>Clymme</hi> of the <hi>Clough</hi> &amp; ſuch other old Romances or hiſtoricall rimes, made purpoſely for recreation of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people at Chriſtmaſſe diners &amp; brideales, and in tauernes &amp; ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and ſuch other places of baſe reſort, alſo they be vſed in Carols and rounds and ſuch light or laſciuious Poemes, which are commonly more commodiouſly vttered by theſe buffons or vices in playes then by any other perſon.

               </p>
               <p>The ſtaffe of nine verſes hath yet moe then the eight, and the ſtaffe often more then the ninth and the twelfth, if ſuch were allowable in ditties, more then any of them all, by reaſon of his largeneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing moe compaſſes and enterweauings, alwayes conſidered that the very large diſtances be more artificiall, then popularly pleaſant, and yet do giue great grace and grauitie, and moue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and affections more vehemently, as it is well to be obſerued by <hi>Petrarcha</hi> his <hi>Canzoni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ye may perceiue by theſe proportions before deſcribed, that there is a band to be giuen euery verſe in a ſtaffe, ſo as none fall out alone or vncoupled, and this band maketh that the ſtaffe is ſayd faſt and not looſe: euen as ye ſee in buildings of ſtone or bricke the maſon giueth a band, that is a length to two breadths, &amp; vpon neceſſitie diuers other ſorts of bands to hold in the worke faſt and maintaine the perpendicularitie of the wall: ſo in any ſtaffe of ſeuen or eight or more verſes, the coupling of the moe meeters by rime or concord, is the faſter band: the fewer the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer band, and therfore in a <hi>huiteine</hi> he that putteth foure verſes in one concord and foure in another concord, and in a <hi>dizaine</hi> fiue, ſheweth him ſelfe more cunning, and alſo more copious in his owne language. For he that can find two words of concord, can not find foure or fiue or ſixe, vnleſſe he haue his owne language at will. Sometime alſo ye are driuen of neceſſitie to cloſe and make band more then ye would, leſt otherwiſe the ſtaffe ſhould fall aſunder and ſeeme two ſtaues: and this is in a ſtaffe of eight and ten verſes: whereas without a band in the middle, it would ſeeme two <hi>quàdriens</hi> or two <hi>quintaines,</hi> which is an error that many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſlide away with. Yet <hi>Chaucer</hi> and others in the ſtaffe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and ſixe do almoſt as much a miſſe, for they ſhut vp the ſtaffe with a <hi>diſticke,</hi> concording with none other verſe that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and maketh but a looſe rime, and yet bycauſe of the double cadence in the laſt two verſes ſerue the eare well inough. And as there is in euery ſtaffe, band, giuen to the verſes by concord more or leſſe buſie: ſo is there in ſome caſes a band giuen to euery ſtaffe,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11025:40"/>
and that is by one whole verſe running alone throughout the ditty or ballade, either in the middle or end of euery ſtaffe. The Greekes called ſuch vncoupled verſe <hi>Epimonie,</hi> the Latines <hi>Verſus interca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.</hi> Now touching the ſituation of meaſures, there are as manie or more proportions of them which I referre to the makers phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie and choiſe, contented with two or three ocular examples and no moe.</p>

               <p>To finiſh the learning of this diuiſion, I will ſet you downe one example of a dittie written extempore with this deuiſe, ſhewing not onely much promptneſſe of wit in the maker, but alſo great arte and a notable memorie. Make me ſaith this writer to one of the companie, ſo many ſtrokes or lines with your pen as ye would haue your ſong containe verſes: and let euery line beare his ſeuerall length, euen as ye would haue your verſe of meaſure. Suppoſe of foure, fiue, ſixe or eight or more ſillables, and ſet a figure of euerie number at th'end of the line, whereby ye may knowe his meaſure. Then where you will haue your rime or concord to fall, marke it with a compaſt ſtroke or ſemicircle paſſing ouer thoſe lines, be they farre or neare in diſtance, as ye haue ſeene before deſcribed. And bycauſe ye ſhall not thinke the maker hath premeditated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand any ſuch faſhioned ditty, do ye your ſelfe make one verſe whether it be of perfect or imperfect ſenſe, and giue it him for a theame to make all the reſt vpon: if ye ſhall perceiue the maker do keepe the meaſures and rime as ye haue appointed him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides do make his dittie ſenſible and enſuant to the firſt verſe in good reaſon, then may ye ſay he is his crafts maiſter. For if he were not of a plentiful diſcourſe, he could not vpon the ſudden ſhape an entire dittie vpon your imperfect theame or propoſition in one
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11025:40"/>
verſe. And if he were not copious in his language, he could not haue ſuch ſtore of wordes at commaundement, as ſhould ſupply your concords. And if he were not of a maruelous good memory he could not obſerue the rime and meaſures after the diſtances of your limitation, keeping with all grauitie and good ſenſe in the whole dittie.</p>

                  <p>Of Proportion in figure.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOur laſt proportion is that of figure, ſo called for that it yelds an ocular repreſentation, your meeters being by good ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie reduced into certaine Geometricall figures, whereby the maker is reſtrained to keepe him within his bounds, and ſheweth not onely more art, but ſerueth alſo much better for briefeneſſe and ſubtiltie of deuice. And for the ſame reſpect are alſo fitteſt for the pretie amourets in Court to entertaine their ſeruants and the time withall, their delicate wits requiring ſome commendable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to keepe them from idleneſſe. I find not of this proportion vſed by any of the Greeke or Latine Poets, or in any vulgar writer, ſauing of that one forme which they cal <hi>Anacreens egge.</hi> But being in Italie conuerſant with a certaine gentleman, who had long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed the Orientall parts of the world, and ſeene the Courts of the great Princes of China and Tartarie. I being very inquiſitiue to know of the ſubtillities of thoſe countreyes, and eſpecially in matter of learning and of their vulgar Poeſie, he told me that they are in all their inuentions moſt wittie, and haue the vſe of Poeſie or riming, but do not delight ſo much as we do in long tedious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and therefore when they will vtter any pretie conceit, they reduce it into metricall feet, and put it in forme of a <hi>Lozange</hi> or ſquare, or ſuch other figure, and ſo engrauen in gold, ſiluer or iuorie, and ſometimes with letters of ametiſt, rubie, emeralde or topas curiouſely cemented and peeced together, they ſende them in chaines, bracelets, collars and girdles to their miſtreſſes to weare for a remembrance. Some fewe meaſures compoſed in this ſort this gentleman gaue me, which I tranſlated word for word and as neere as I could followed both the phraſe and the figure, which is ſomewhat hard to performe, becauſe of the reſtraint of the figure from which ye may not digreſſe. At the beginning they wil ſeeme

The Greekes call it <hi>Emblema,</hi> the Italiens <hi>Impreſa,</hi> and we, a Deuice, ſuch as a man may put into letters of gold and ſende to his miſtreſſes for a token, or cauſe to be embrodered in ſcutchions of armes, or in any bordure of a rich garment to giue by his noueltie maruell to the beholder.

                  <p>We our ſelues attributing that moſt excellent figure, for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable beauty and light, to the perſon of our Soueraigne lady altring the mot, made it farre paſſe that of Th'Emperour <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus</hi> both for ſubtilitie and multiplicitie of ſenſe, thus, <hi>[Soli nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam deficienti]</hi> to her onely that neuer failes, viz. in bountie and munificence toward all hers that deſerue, or elſe thus, To her onely (whoſe glorie and good fortune may neuer decay or wane.

There can not be a more excellent deuiſe, nor that could containe larger intendment, nor greater ſubtilitie, nor (as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſay) more vertue or Princely generoſite.

                  <p>King <hi>Levvis</hi> the twelfth, a valiant and magnanimous prince, who becauſe hee was on euery ſide enuironed with mightie neighbours, and moſt of them his enemies, to let them perceiue that they ſhould not finde him vnable or vnfurniſhed (incaſe they ſhould offer any vnlawfull hoſtillitie) of ſuffificient forces of his owne, aſwell to offende as to defend, and to reuenge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie as to repulſe it.

The heraldes ought to vſe great diſcretion in ſuch matters: for neither any rule of their arte doth warrant ſuch abſurdities, nor though ſuch a coat or creſt were gained by a priſoner taken in the field, or by a flag found in ſome ditch &amp; neuer fought for (as many times happens) yet is it no more allowable then it were to beare the deuice of <hi>Tamerlan</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in Tartary, who gaue the lightning of heauen, with a poſie in that language purporting theſe words, <hi>Ira Dei,</hi> which alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well to anſwer his fortune. For from a ſturdie ſhepeheard he became a moſt mighty Emperour, and with his innumerable great armies deſolated ſo many countreyes and people, as he might iuſtly be called <hi>[the vvrath of God.]</hi> It appeared alſo by his ſtrange ende: for in the midſt of his greatneſſe and proſperitie he died ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, &amp; left no child or kinred for a ſucceſſour to ſo large an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, nor any memory after him more then of his great puiſſance and crueltie.</p>

Which poſie with maruellous much reaſon and ſubtillity implieth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euery ſubiect to his Prince, and of euery Prince to his ſubiect, and that without either of them both, no ſubiect could be ſayd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to performe his liegeance, nor the Prince his part of lawfull gouernement. For without feare and loue the ſoueraigne authority could not be vpholden, nor without iuſtice and mercy the Prince be renowmed and honored of his ſubiect. All which parts are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in this figure: loue by the ſerpents amorous entertangling: obedience and feare by putting the inferiours head into the others mouth hauing puiſſance to deſtroy. On th'other ſide, iuſtice in the greater to prepare and manace death and deſtruction to offenders. And if he ſpare it, then betokeneth it mercie, and a grateful recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the loue and obedience which the ſoueraigne receaueth.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11025:51"/>
in this word <hi>[contribūtĭŏn]</hi> which makes a good <hi>ſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deus</hi> &amp; a good <hi>dactill,</hi> and in this word <hi>[recāpĭtŭlātĭŏn]</hi> it makes two <hi>dactills</hi> and a ſillable ouerplus to annexe to the word precedent to helpe peece vp another foote. But for wordes <hi>monoſillables</hi> (as be moſt of ours) becauſe in pronouncing them they do of neceſſitie retaine a ſharpe accent, ye may iuſtly allow them to be all long if they will ſo beſt ſerue your turne, and if they be tailed one to another, or th'one to a <hi>diſſillable</hi> or <hi>polyſſillable</hi> ye ought to allow them that time that beſt ſerues your purpoſe and pleaſeth your eare moſt, and trulieſt aunſweres the nature of the <hi>ortographie</hi> in which I would as neare as I could obſerue and keepe the lawes of the Greeke and Latine verſifiers, that is to prolong the ſillable which is written with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſonants or by dipthong or with ſingle conſonants that run hard and harſhly vpon the toung: and to ſhorten all ſillables that ſtand vpon vowels, if there were no cauſe of <hi>eliſion</hi> and ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants &amp; ſuch of them as are moſt flowing and flipper vpon the toung as. <hi>n.r.t.d.l.</hi> and for this purpoſe to take away all aſpirations, and many times the laſt conſonant of a word as the Latine Poetes vſed to do, ſpecially <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Ennius</hi> as to ſay <hi>[finibu]</hi> for <hi>[fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus]</hi> and ſo would not I ſtick to ſay thus <hi>[delite]</hi> for <hi>[delight] [hye]</hi> for <hi>[high]</hi> and ſuch like, &amp; doth nothing at all impugne the rule I gaue before againſt the wreſting of wordes by falſe <hi>ortogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie</hi> to make vp rime, which may not be falſified. But this omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of letters in the middeſt of a meetre to make him the more ſlipper, helpes the numeroſitie and hinders not the rime. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſhortning or prolonging of the <hi>monoſillables</hi> dependes much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of their <hi>ortographie</hi> which the Latin Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariens call the rule of poſition, as for example if I ſhall ſay thus.

And no doubt by like conſideration did the Greeke &amp; Latine verſifiers faſhion all their feete at the firſt to be of ſundry times, and the ſelfe ſame ſillable to be ſometime long and ſometime ſhort for the eares better ſatisfaction as hath bene before reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred. Now alſo wheras I ſaid before that our old Saxon Engliſh for his many <hi>monoſillables</hi> did not naturally admit the vſe of the ancient feete in our vulgar meaſures ſo aptly as in thoſe languages which ſtood moſt vpon <hi>poliſillables,</hi> I ſayd it in a ſort truly, but now I muſt recant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that our Normane Engliſh which hath growen ſince <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour doth admit any of the auncient feete, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the many <hi>polyſillables</hi> euen to ſixe and ſeauen in one word, which we at this day vſe in our moſt ordinarie language: and which corruption hath bene occaſioned chiefly by the peeuiſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation not of the Normans them ſelues, but of clerks and ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or ſecretaries long ſince, who not content with the vſual Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Saxon word, would conuert the very Latine and Greeke word into vulgar French, as to ſay innumerable for innombrable, reuocable, irreuocable, irradiation, depopulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſuch like, which are not naturall Normans nor yet French, but altered Latines, and without any imitation at all: which therefore were long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed for inkehorne termes and now be reputed the beſt &amp; moſt delicat of any other. Of which &amp; many other cauſes of corruption of our ſpeach we haue in another place more amply diſcourſed, but by this meane we may at this day very well receiue the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent feete <hi>metricall</hi> of the Greeks and Latines ſauing thoſe that be ſuperflous as be all the feete aboue the <hi>triſſillable,</hi> which the old Grammarians idly inuented and diſtinguiſht by ſpeciall names, whereas in deede the ſame do ſtand compounded with the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our feete, and therefore ſome of them were called by the names of <hi>didactilus, diſpondeus</hi> and <hi>diſiambus:</hi> all which feete as I ſay we may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11025:52"/>
be allowed to vſe with good diſcretion &amp; preciſe choiſe of wordes and with the fauorable approbation of readers, and ſo ſhall our plat in this one point be larger and much ſurmount that which <hi>Stamhurſt</hi> firſt tooke in hand by his <hi>exameters dactilicke</hi> and <hi>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicke</hi> in the tranſlation of <hi>Virgills Eneidos,</hi> and ſuch as for a great number of them my ſtomacke can hardly digeſt for the ill ſhapen ſound of many of his wordes <hi>poliſillable</hi> and alſo his copulation of <hi>monoſillables</hi> ſupplying the quantitie of a <hi>triſſillable</hi> to his intent. And right ſo in promoting this deuiſe of ours being (I feare me) much more nyce and affected, and therefore more miſliked then his, we are to beſpeake fauour, firſt of the delicate eares, then of the rigorous and ſeuere diſpoſitions, laſtly to craue pardon of the learned &amp; auncient makers in our vulgar, for if we ſhould ſeeke in euery point to egall our ſpeach with the Greeke and Latin in their <hi>metricall</hi> obſeruations it could not poſſible be by vs perfourmed, becauſe their ſillables came to be timed ſome of them long, ſome of them ſhort not by reaſon of any euident or apparant cauſe in writing or ſounde remaining vpon one more then another, for many times they ſhortned the ſillable of ſharpe accent and made long that of the flat, &amp; therefore we muſt needes ſay, it was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their wordes done by preelection in the firſt Poetes, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard altogether to the <hi>ortographie,</hi> and hardneſſe or ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a ſillable, conſonant, vowell or dipthong, but at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or as it fell out: ſo as he that firſt put in a verſe this word <hi>[Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope]</hi> which might be <hi>Homer</hi> or ſome other of his antiquitie, where he made <hi>[pē]</hi> in both places long and <hi>[nĕ]</hi> and <hi>[lŏ]</hi> ſhort, he might haue made them otherwiſe and with as good reaſon, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world appearing that might moue them to make ſuch (preelection) more in th'one ſillable then in the other for <hi>pe. ne.</hi> and <hi>lo.</hi> being ſillables vocals be egally ſmoth and currant vpon the toung, and might beare aſwel the long as the ſhort time, but it pleaſed the Poet otherwiſe: ſo he that firſt ſhortned, <hi>ca.</hi> in this word <hi>cano,</hi> and made long <hi>tro,</hi> in <hi>troia,</hi> and <hi>o,</hi> in <hi>oris,</hi> might haue aſwell done the contrary, but becauſe he that firſt put them into a verſe, found as it is to be ſuppoſed a more ſweetneſſe in his owne eare to haue them ſo tymed, therefore all other Poets who followed, were fayne to doe the like, which made that <hi>Virgill</hi> who came many

               <p>Neither truely doe I ſee any other reaſon in that lawe (though in other rules of ſhortning and prolonging a ſillable there may be reaſon) but that it ſtands vpon bare tradition.

               </argument>
               <p>THeir Grammarians made a great multitude of feete, I wot not to what huge number, and of ſo many ſizes as their wordes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11025:53"/>
were of length, namely ſixe ſizes, whereas in deede, the metricall feete are but twelue in number, wherof foure only be of two times, and eight of three times, the reſt compounds of the premiſed two ſorts, euen as the Arithmeticall numbers aboue three are made of two and three. And if ye will know how many of theſe feete will be commodiouſly receiued with vs, I ſay all the whole twelue, for firſt for the foote <hi>ſpondeus</hi> of two long times ye haue theſe Engliſh wordes <hi>mōrnīng, mīdnīght, mīſchāunce,</hi> and a number moe whoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tographie may direct your iudgement in this point: for your <hi>Trocheus</hi> of a long and ſhort ye haue theſe wordes <hi>mānĕr, brōkĕn, tākĕn, bōdiĕ, mēmbĕr,</hi> and a great many moe if their laſt ſillables a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but not vpon the conſonant in the beginning of another word, and in theſe whether they do abut or no <hi>wīttĭe, dīttĭe, sōrrŏw, mōr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rŏw,</hi> &amp; ſuch like, which end in a vowell for your <hi>Iambus</hi> of a ſhort and a long, ye haue theſe wordes <hi>[rĕſtōre] [rĕmōrſe] [dĕsīre] [ĕn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dūre]</hi> and a thouſand beſides. For your foote <hi>pirrichius</hi> or of two ſhort ſilables ye haue theſe words <hi>[mănĭe] [mŏnĕy] [pĕnĭe] [sĭliĕ]</hi> and others of that conſtitution or the like: for your feete of three times and firſt your <hi>dactill,</hi> ye haue theſe wordes &amp; a number moe <hi>pātĭĕnce, tēmpĕrănce, vvōmănheăd, iōlĭtĭe, daungĕrŏus, dūetĭfŭll</hi> &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For your <hi>moloſſus,</hi> of all three long, ye haue a member of wordes alſo and ſpecially moſt of your participles actiue, as <hi>pērsī<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtīng, dĕſpōilīng, ēndēntīng,</hi> and ſuch like in ortographie: for your <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napeſtus</hi> of two ſhort and a long ye haue theſe words but not many moe, as <hi>mănĭfōld, mŏnĭlēſſe, rĕmănēnt, hŏlĭnēſſe.</hi> For your foote <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracchus</hi> of all three ſhort, ye haue very few <hi>triſſillables,</hi> becauſe the ſharpe accent will always make one of them long by pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, which els would be by ortographie ſhort as, <hi>[mĕrĭly] [mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion]</hi> &amp; ſuch like. For your foote <hi>bacchius</hi> of a ſhort &amp; two long ye haue theſe and the like words <hi>triſſillables [lămēntīng] [rĕquēſtīng] [rĕnoūncīng] [rĕpēntānce] [ĕnūrīng].</hi> For your foote <hi>antibacchius,</hi> of two long and a ſhort ye haue theſe wordes <hi>[fōrsākĕn] [īmpūg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nĕd]</hi> and others many: For your <hi>amphimacer</hi> that is a long a ſhort and a long ye haue theſe wordes and many moe <hi>[éxcellént] [īmĭ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nēnt]</hi> and ſpecially ſuch as be propre names of perſons or townes or other things and namely Welſh wordes: for your foote <hi>amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracchus,</hi> of a ſhort, a long and a ſhort, ye haue theſe wordes and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11025:53"/>
many like to theſe <hi>[rĕsīſtĕd] [dĕlīghtfŭll] [rĕprīſăll] [ĭnăuntĕr] [ĕnāmĭll]</hi> ſo as for want of Engliſh wordes if your eare be not to daintie and your rules to preciſe, ye neede not be without the <hi>metricall</hi> feete of the ancient Poets ſuch as be moſt pertinent and not ſuperfluous. This is (ye will perchaunce ſay) my ſingular opinion: then ye ſhall ſee how well I can maintaine it. Firſt the quantitie of a word comes either by (preelection) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon or force as hath bene alledged, and as the auncient Greekes and Latines did in many wordes, but not in all, or by (ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) with reaſon as they did in ſome, and not a few. And a ſound is drawen at length either by the infirmitie of the toung, becauſe the word or ſillable is of ſuch letters as hangs long in the palate or lippes ere he will come forth, or becauſe he is accented and tuned hier and ſharper then another, whereby he ſomewhat obſcureth the other ſillables in the ſame word that be not accented ſo high, in both theſe caſes we will eſtabliſh our ſillable long, contrariwiſe the ſhortning of a ſillable is, when his ſounde or accent happens to be heauy and flat, that is to fall away ſpeedily, and as it were inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, or when he is made of ſuch letters as be by nature ſlipper &amp; voluble and ſmoothly paſſe from the mouth. And the vowell is alwayes more eaſily deliuered then the conſonant: and of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the liquide more then the mute, &amp; a ſingle conſonant more then a double, and one more then twayne coupled together: all which points were obſerued by the Greekes and Latines, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for <hi>maximes</hi> in verſifying. Now if ye will examine theſe foure <hi>biſſillables [rēmnānt] [rĕmāine] [rēnder] [rĕnĕt]</hi> for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by which ye may make a generall rule, and ye ſhall finde, that they aunſwere our firſt reſolution. Firſt in <hi>[remnant] [rem]</hi> bearing the ſharpe accent and hauing his conſonant abbut vpon another, ſoundes long. The ſillable <hi>[nant]</hi> being written with two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonants muſt needs be accompted the ſame beſides that <hi>[nant]</hi> by his Latin originall is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, viz. <hi>[remanēns.]</hi> Take this word <hi>[re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine]</hi> becauſe the laſt ſillable beares the ſharpe accent, he is long in the eare, and <hi>[re]</hi> being the firſt ſillable, paſſing obſcurely away with a flat accent is ſhort, beſides that <hi>[re]</hi> by his Latine originall and alſo by his ortographie is ſhort. This word <hi>[render]</hi> bearing the ſharpe acce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon <hi>[ren]</hi> makes it long, the ſillable <hi>[der]</hi> falling
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11025:54"/>
away ſwiftly &amp; being alſo writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a ſingle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonant or liquide is ſhort and makes the <hi>trocheus.</hi> This word <hi>[rĕnēt]</hi> hauing both ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables ſliding and ſlipper make the foote <hi>Pirrichius,</hi> becauſe if he be truly vttered he beares in maner no ſharper accent vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one then the other ſillable, but be in effect egall in time and tune, as is alſo the <hi>Spondeus.</hi> And becauſe they be not written with any hard or harſh conſonants, I do allow them both for ſhort ſillables, or to be vſed for common, according as their ſituation and place with other words ſhall be: and as I haue named to you but onely foure words for an example, ſo may ye find out by diligent obſeruation foure hundred if ye will. But of all your words <hi>biſſillables</hi> the moſt part naturally do make the foot <hi>Iambus,</hi> many the <hi>Trocheus,</hi> fewer the <hi>Spondeus,</hi> feweſt of all the <hi>Pirrichius,</hi> becauſe in him the ſharpe accent (if ye follow the rules of your accent, as we haue preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) doth make a litle oddes: and ye ſhall find verſes made all of <hi>monoſillables,</hi> and do very well, but lightly they be <hi>Iambickes,</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the more part the accent falles ſharpe vpon euery ſecond word rather then contrariwiſe, as this of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiats.</hi>

                  <p>Of your feet of three times, and firſt of the Dactil.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOur feete of three times by preſcription of the Latine Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariens are of eight ſundry proportions, for ſome notable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference appearing in euery ſillable of three falling in a word of that ſize: but becauſe aboue the <hi>antepenultima</hi> there was (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines) none accent audible in any long word, therfore to deuiſe any foote of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger meaſure then of three times was to them but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: becauſe all aboue the number of three are but compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their inferiours. Omitting therefore to ſpeake of theſe lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger feete, we ſay that of all your feete of three times the <hi>Dactill</hi> is moſt vſuall and fit for our vulgar meeter, &amp; moſt agreeable to the eare, ſpecially if ye ouerlade not your verſe with too many of them but here and there enterlace a <hi>Iambus</hi> or ſome other foote of two times to giue him grauitie and ſtay, as in this <hi>quadrein Trimeter</hi> or of three meaſures.</p>

               <p>Where ye ſee euery verſe is all of a meaſure, and yet vnegall in number of ſillables: for the ſecond verſe is but of ſixe ſillables, where the reſt are of eight. But the reaſon is for that in three of the ſame verſes are two <hi>Dactils</hi> a peece, which abridge two ſillables in euery verſe: and ſo maketh the longeſt euen with the ſhorteſt. Ye may note beſides by the firſt verſe, how much better ſome <hi>biſſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> becommeth to peece out an other longer foote then another word doth: for in place of <hi>[render]</hi> if ye had ſayd <hi>[reſtore]</hi> it had marred the <hi>Dactil,</hi> and of neceſſitie driuen him out at length to be a verſe <hi>Iambie</hi> of foure feet, becauſe <hi>[render]</hi> is naturally a <hi>Trocheus</hi> &amp; makes the firſt two times of a <hi>dactil.

               <p>ALl your other feete of three times I find no vſe of them in our vulgar meeters nor no ſweetenes at all, and yet words inough to ſerue their proportions. So as though they haue not hitherto bene made artificiall, yet nowe by more curious obſeruation they might be. Since all artes grew firſt by obſeruation of natures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and cuſtome.

Where in your firſt ſecond and fourth verſe, ye may find a ſillable ſuperfluous, and though in the firſt ye will ſeeme to helpe it, by drawing theſe three ſillables, <hi>[īm mĕ sŭ]</hi> into a <hi>dactil,</hi> in the reſt it can not be ſo excuſed, wherefore we muſt thinke he did it of purpoſe, by the odde ſillable to giue greater grace to his meetre, and we finde in our old rimes, this odde ſillable, ſometime placed in the beginning and ſometimes in the middle of a verſe, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to go alone &amp; to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to any other ſillable.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S no doubt the good proportion of any thing doth greatly adorne and commend it and right ſo our late remembred propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe to our vulgar Poeſie: ſo is there yet requiſite to the perfection of this arte, another maner of exornation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the faſhioning of our makers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ſtile, to ſuch purpoſe as it may delight and allure as well the mynde as the eare of the hearers with a certaine noueltie and ſtrange maner of conueyance, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing it no litle from the ordinary and accuſtomed: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe making it nothing the more vnſeemely or misbecomming, but rather decenter and more agreable to any ciuill eare and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And as we ſee in theſe great Madames of honour, be they for perſonage or otherwiſe neuer ſo comely and bewti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet if they want their courtly habillements or at leaſtwiſe ſuch other apparell as cuſtome and ciuilitie haue ordained to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their naked bodies, would be halfe aſhamed or greatly out of countenaunce to be ſeen in that ſort, and perchance do then thinke themſelues more amiable in euery mans eye, when they be in their richeſt attire, ſuppoſe of ſilkes or tyſſewes &amp; coſtly embroderies, then when they go in cloth or in any other plaine and ſimple ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell.

               <argument>
                  <p>How our writing and ſpeaches publike ought to be figuratiue, and if they be not doe greatly diſgrace the cauſe and purpoſe of the ſpeaker and writer.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BVt as it hath bene alwayes reputed a great fault to vſe figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeaches fooliſhly and indiſcretly, ſo is it eſteemed no leſſe an imperfection in mans vtterance, to haue none vſe of figure at all, ſpecially in our writing and ſpeaches publike, making them but as our ordinary talke, then which nothing can be more vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie and farre from all ciuilitie. I remember in the firſt yeare of Queenes Maries raigne a Knight of Yorkſhire was choſen ſpeaker of the Parliament, a good gentleman and wiſe, in the affaires of his ſhire, and not vnlearned in the lawes of the Realme, but as well for ſome lack of his teeth, as for want of language no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11025:61"/>
thing well ſpoken, which at that time and buſineſſe was moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooffull for him to haue bene: this man after he had made his Oration to the Queene; which ye know is of courſe to be done at the firſt aſſembly of both houſes; a bencher of the Temple both well learned and very eloquent, returning from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſe asked another gentleman his frend how he liked M. Speakers Oration: mary quoth th'other, me thinks I heard not a better alehouſe tale told this ſeuen yeares. This happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the good old Knight made no difference betweene an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or publike ſpeach to be deliuered to th'eare of a Princes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and ſtate of a Realme, then he would haue done of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tale to be told at his table in the countrey, wherein all men know the oddes is very great. And though graue and wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours in their conſultations doe not vſe much ſuperfluous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and alſo in their iudiciall hearings do much miſlike all ſcholaſticall rhetoricks: yet in ſuch a caſe as it may be (and as this Parliament was) if the Lord Chancelour of England or Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury himſelfe were to ſpeake, he ought to doe it cunningly and eloquently, which can not be without the vſe of figures: and neuertheleſſe none impeachment or blemiſh to the grauitie of their perſons or of the cauſe: wherein I report me to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that knew Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon</hi> Lord keeper of the great Seale, or the now Lord Treaſorer of England, and haue bene conuerſant with their ſpeaches made in the Parliament houſe &amp; Starrecham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. From whoſe lippes I haue ſeene to proceede more graue and naturall eloquence, then from all the Oratours of Oxford or Cambridge, but all is as it is handled, and maketh no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame eloquence be naturall to them or artificiall (though I, thinke rather naturall) yet were they knowen to be learned and not vnskilfull of th'arte, when they were yonger men: and as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and arte teacheth a ſchollar to ſpeake, ſo doth it alſo teach a counſellour, and aſwell an old man as a yong, and a man in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, aſwell as a priuate perſon, and a pleader aſwell as a preacher, euery man after his ſort and calling as beſt becommeth: and that ſpeach which becommeth one, doth not become another, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ſpeaches, ſome ſerue to work in exceſſe, ſome in mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſome to graue purpoſes, ſome to light, ſome to be ſhort and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11025:61"/>
brief, ſome to be long, ſome to ſtirre vp affections, ſome to pacifie and appeaſe them, and theſe common deſpiſers of good vtterance, which reſteth altogether in figuratiue ſpeaches, being well vſed whether it come by nature or by arte or by exerciſe, they be but certaine groſſe ignorance of whom it is truly ſpoken <hi>ſcientia non habet inimicum niſi ignorantem.</hi> I haue come to the Lord Keeper Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> &amp; found him ſitting in his gallery alone with the works of <hi>Quintilian</hi> before him, in deede he was a moſt eloquent man, and of rare learning and wiſedome, as euer I knew England to breed, and one that ioyed as much in learned men and men of good witts. A Knight of the Queenes priuie chamber, once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated a noble woman of the Court, being in great fauour about her Maieſtie (to th'intent to remoue her from a certaine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which by ſiniſter opinion ſhe had conceiued againſt a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his friend) that it would pleaſe her to heare him ſpeake in his own cauſe &amp; not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne him vpon his aduerſaries report: God forbid ſaid ſhe, he is to wiſe for me to talke with, let him goe and ſatisfie ſuch a man naming him: why quoth the Knight againe, had your Ladyſhip rather heare a man talke like a foole or like a wiſe man? This was becauſe the Lady was a litle peruerſe, and not diſpoſed to reforme her ſelfe by hearing reaſon, which none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ſo well beate into the ignorant head, as the well ſpoken and eloquent man. And becauſe I am ſo farre waded into this diſcourſe of eloquence and figuratiue ſpeaches, I will tell you what hapned on a time my ſelfe being preſent when certaine Doctours of the ciuil law were heard in a litigious cauſe betwixt a man and his wife: before a great Magiſtrat who (as they can tell that knew him) was a man very well learned and graue, but ſomewhat ſowre, and of no plauſible vtterance: the gentlemans chaunce, was to ſay: my Lord the ſimple woman is not ſo much to blame as her lewde abbettours, who by violent perſwaſions haue lead her into this wilfulneſſe. Quoth the iudge, what neede ſuch eloquent termes in this place, the gentleman replied, doth your Lordſhip miſlike the terme, <hi>[violent]</hi> &amp; me thinkes I ſpeake it to great purpoſe: for I am ſure ſhe would neuer haue done it, but by force of perſwaſion: &amp; if perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were not very violent, to the minde of man it could not haue wrought ſo ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge an effect as we read that it did once in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:11025:62"/>
&amp; would haue told the whole tale at large, if the Magiſtrate had not paſſed it ouer very pleaſantly. Now to tell you the whole matter as the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, thus it was. There came into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt a notable Oratour, whoſe name was <hi>Hegeſias</hi> who inueyed ſo much againſt the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this tranſitory life, &amp; ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended death the diſpatcher of all euils; as a great number of his hearers deſtroyed themſelues, ſome with weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome with poyſon, others by drowning and hanging themſelues to be rid out of this vale of miſery, in ſo much as it was feared leaſt many moe of the people would haue miſcaried by occaſion of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, if king <hi>Ptolome</hi> had not made a publicke proclamation, that the Oratour ſhould auoyde the countrey, and no more be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſpeake in any matter. Whether now perſwaſions, may not be ſaid violent and forcible to ſimple myndes in ſpeciall, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to all mens iudgements that heare the ſtory. At leaſt waies, I finde this opinion, confirmed by a pretie deuiſe or embleme that <hi>Lucianus</hi> alleageth he ſaw in the pourtrait of <hi>Hercules</hi> within the Citie of Marſeills in Prouence: where they had figured a luſtie old man with a long chayne tyed by one end at his tong by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end at the peoples eares, who ſtood a farre of and ſeemed to be drawen to him by the force of that chayne faſtned to his tong, as who would ſay, by force of his perſwaſions. And to ſhew more plainly that eloquence is of great force (and not as many men thinke amiſſe) the propertie and gift of yong men onely, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of old men, and a thing which better becommeth hory haires then beardleſſe boyes, they ſeeme to ground it vpon this reaſon: age (ſay they and moſt truly) brings experience, experience brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth wiſedome, long life yeldes long vſe and much exerciſe of ſpeach, exerciſe and cuſtome with wiſedome, make an aſſured and volluble vtterance: ſo is it that old men more then any other ſort ſpeake moſt grauely, wiſely, aſſuredly, and plauſibly, which partes are all that can be required in perfite eloquence, and ſo in all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations of importance where counſellours are allowed freely to opyne &amp; ſhew their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits, good perſwaſion is no leſſe requiſite then ſpeach it ſelfe: for in great purpoſes to ſpeake and not to be able or likely to perſwade, is a vayne thing: now let vs returne backe to ſay more of this Poeticall ornament.</p>

                  <p>How ornament Poeticall is of two ſortes according to the double vertue and efficacie of figures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis ornament then is of two ſortes, one to ſatisfie &amp; delight th'eare onely by a goodly outward ſhew ſet vpon the matter with wordes, and ſpeaches ſmothly and tunably running: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by certaine intendments or ſence of ſuch wordes &amp; ſpeaches inwardly working a ſtirre to the mynde: that firſt qualitie the Greeks called <hi>Enargia,</hi> of this word <hi>argos,</hi> becauſe it geueth a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious luſtre and light. This latter they called <hi>Energia</hi> of <hi>ergon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wrought with a ſtrong and vertuous operation; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure breedeth them both, ſome ſeruing to giue gloſſe onely to a language, ſome to geue it efficacie by ſence, and ſo by that meanes ſome of them ſerue th'eare onely, ſome ſerue the conceit onely and not th'eare: there be of them alſo that ſerue both turnes as commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruitours appointed for th'one and th'other purpoſe, which ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be hereafter ſpoken of in place: but becauſe we haue alleaged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ornament is but the good or rather bewtifull habite of language and ſtile, and figuratiue ſpeaches the inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we burniſh our language faſhioning it to this or that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and proportion, whence finally reſulteth a long and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all phraſe or maner of writing or ſpeach, which we call by the name of <hi>ſtile:</hi> we wil firſt ſpeake of language, then of ſtile, laſtly of figure, and declare their vertue and differences, and alſo their vſe and beſt application, &amp; what portion in exornation euery of them bringeth to the bewtifying of this Arte.</p>

                  <p>Of Language.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SPeach is not naturall to man ſauing for his onely habilitie to ſpeake, and that he is by kinde apt to vtter all his conceits with ſounds and voyces diuerſified many maner of wayes, by meanes of the many &amp; fit inſtruments he hath by nature to that purpoſe, as a broad and voluble tong, thinne and mouable lippes, teeth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and not ſhagged, thick ranged, a round vaulted pallate, and a long throte, beſides an excellent capacitie of wit that maketh him more diſciplinable and imitatiue then any other creature: then as to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11025:63"/>
forme and action of his ſpeach, it commeth to him by arte &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and by vſe or exerciſe. But after a ſpeach is fully faſhioned to the common vnderſtanding, &amp; accepted by conſent of a whole countrey &amp; natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is called a language, &amp; receaueth none allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alteration, but by extraordinary occaſions by little &amp; little, as it were inſenſibly bringing in of many corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that creepe along with the time: of all which matters, we haue more largely ſpoken in our bookes of the originals and pedigree of the Engliſh tong. Then when I ſay language, I meane the ſpeach wherein the Poet or maker writeth be it Greek or Latine, or as our caſe is the vulgar Engliſh, &amp; when it is peculiar vnto a countrey it is called the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeach of that people: the Greekes terme it <hi>Idioma:</hi> ſo is ours at this day the Norman Engliſh. Before the Conqueſt of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans it was the Angleſaxon, and before that the Britiſh, which as ſome will, is at this day, the Walſh, or as others affirme the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: I for my part thinke neither of both, as they be now ſpoken and ponounced. This part in our maker or Poet muſt be heedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked vnto, that it be naturall, pure, and the moſt vſuall of all his countrey: and for the ſame purpoſe rather that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the kings Court, or in the good townes and Cities within the land, then in the marches and frontiers, or in port townes, where ſtraungers haunt for traffike ſake, or yet in Vniuerſities where Schollers vſe much peeuiſh affectation of words out of the primatiue languages, or finally, in any vplandiſh village or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Realme, where is no reſort but of poore ruſticall or vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill people: neither ſhall he follow the ſpeach of a craftes man or carter, or other of the inferiour ſort, though he be inhabitant or bred in the beſt towne and Citie in this Realme, for ſuch perſons doe abuſe good ſpeaches by ſtrange accents or ill ſhapen ſoundes, and falſe ortographie. But he ſhall follow generally the better brought vp ſort, ſuch as the Greekes call <hi>[charientes]</hi> men ciuill and graciouſly behauoured and bred. Our maker therfore at theſe dayes ſhall not follow <hi>Piers plowman</hi> nor <hi>Gower</hi> nor <hi>Lydgate</hi> nor yet <hi>Chaucer,</hi> for their language is now out of vſe with vs: neither ſhall he take the termes of Northern-men, ſuch as they vſe in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talke, whether they be noble men or gentlemen, or of their beſt clarkes all is a matter: nor in effect any ſpeach vſed beyond the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11025:63"/>
riuer of Trent, though no man can deny but that theirs is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Engliſh Saxon at this day, yet it is not ſo Courtly nor ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as our Southerne Engliſh is, no more is the far Weſterne ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſpeach: ye ſhall therfore take the vſuall ſpeach of the Court, and that of London and the ſhires lying about London within lx. myles, and not much aboue. I ſay not this but that in euery ſhyre of England there be gentlemen and others that ſpeake but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly write as good Southerne as we of Middleſex or Surrey do, but not the common people of euery ſhire, to whom the gentlemen, and alſo their learned clarkes do for the moſt part condeſcend, but herein we are already ruled by th'Engliſh Dictionaries and other bookes written by learned men, and therefore it needeth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direction in that behalfe. Albeit peraduenture ſome ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition be not impertinent, for we finde in our Engliſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters many wordes and ſpeaches amendable, &amp; ye ſhall ſee in ſome many inkhorne termes ſo ill affected brought in by men of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as preachers and ſchoolemaſters: and many ſtraunge termes of other languages by Secretaries and Marchaunts and trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and many darke wordes and not vſuall nor well ſounding, though they be dayly ſpoken in Court. Wherefore great heed muſt be taken by our maker in this point that his choiſe be good. And peraduenture the writer hereof be in that behalfe no leſſe faultie then any other, vſing many ſtraunge and vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wordes and borrowed from other languages: and in that reſpect him ſelfe no meete Magiſtrate to reforme the ſame errours in any other perſon, but ſince he is not vnwilling to acknowledge his owne fault, and can the better tell how to amend it, he may ſeeme a more excuſable correctour of other mens: he intendeth therefore for an indifferent way and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall benefite to taxe him ſelfe firſt and before any others.</p>
               <p>Theſe be words vſed by th'author in this preſent treatiſe, <hi>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke,</hi> but with ſome reaſon, for it anſwereth the word <hi>mechanicall,</hi> which no other word could haue done ſo properly, for when hee ſpake of all artificers which reſt either in ſcience or in handy craft, it followed neceſſarilie that <hi>ſcientifique</hi> ſhould be coupled with <hi>mechanicall:</hi> or els neither of both to haue bene allowed, but in their places: a man of ſcience liberall, and a handicrafts man, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11025:64"/>

A man might haue ſaid in ſteade of <hi>Maior-domo,</hi> the French word <hi>(maistre d'hoſtell)</hi> but ilfauouredly, or the right Engliſh word <hi>(Lord Steward.)</hi> But me thinks for my owne opinion this word <hi>Maior-domo</hi> though he be borrowed, is more acceptable tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of the reſt, other men may iudge otherwiſe. <hi>Politien,</hi> this word alſo is receiued from the Frenchmen, but at this day vſuall in Court and with all good Secretaries: and cannot finde an Engliſh word to match him, for to haue ſaid a man politique, had not bene ſo wel: bicauſe in trueth that had bene no more than to haue ſaid a ciuil perſon. <hi>Politien</hi> is rather a ſurueyour of ciuilitie than ciuil, &amp; a publique miniſter or Counſeller in the ſtate. Ye haue alſo this worde <hi>Conduict,</hi> a French word, but well allowed of vs, and long ſince vſuall, it ſoundes ſomewhat more than this word (leading) for it is applied onely to the leading of a Captaine, and not as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boy ſhould leade a blinde man, therefore more proper to the caſe when he ſaide, <hi>conduict</hi> of whole armies: ye finde alſo this word <hi>Idiome,</hi> taken from the Greekes, yet ſeruing aptly, when a man wanteth to expreſſe ſo much vnles it be in two words, which ſurpluſſage to auoide, we are allowed to draw in other words ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and aſmuch ſignificatiue: this word <hi>ſignificatiue</hi> is borrowed of the Latine and French, but to vs brought in firſt by ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-mans Secretarie, as I thinke, yet doth ſo well ſerue the turne, as it could not now be ſpared: and many more like vſurped Latine and French words: as, <hi>Methode, methodicall, placation, function, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubtiling, refining, compendious, prolixe, figuratiue, inueigle.</hi> A terme borrowed of our common Lawyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Stile.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>STile is a conſtant &amp; continuall phraſe or tenour of ſpeaking and writing, extending to the whole tale or proceſſe of the poeme or hiſtorie, and not properly to any peece or member of a tale: but is of words ſpeeches and ſentences together, a certaine contriued forme and qualitie, many times naturall to the writer, many times his peculier by election and arte, and ſuch as either he keepeth by skill, or holdeth on by ignorance, and will not or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture cannot eaſily alter into any other. So we ſay that <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> ſtile, and <hi>Saluſts</hi> were not one, nor <hi>Ceſars</hi> and <hi>Liuies,</hi> nor <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> and <hi>Heſiodus,</hi> nor <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Theucidides,</hi> nor <hi>Euripides</hi> &amp; <hi>Ariſtophones,</hi> nor <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Budeus</hi> ſtiles. And becauſe this continuall courſe and manner of writing or ſpeech ſheweth the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11025:65"/>
matter and diſpoſition of the writers minde, more than one or few words or ſentences can ſhew, therefore there be that haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſtile, the image of man <hi>[mentis character]</hi> for man is but his minde, and as his minde is tempered and qualified, ſo are his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and language at large, and his inward conceits be the mettall of his minde and his manner of vtterance the very warp &amp; woofe of his conceits, more plaine, or buſie and intricate, or otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected after the rate. Moſt men ſay that not any one point in all <hi>Phiſiognomy</hi> is ſo certaine, as to iudge a mans manners by his eye: but more aſſuredly in mine opinion, by his dayly maner of ſpeech and ordinary writing. For if the man be graue, his ſpeech and ſtile is graue: if light-headed, his ſtile and language alſo light: if the minde be haughtie and hoate, the ſpeech and ſtile is alſo vehement and ſtirring: if it be colde and temperate, the ſtile is alſo very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt: if it be humble, or baſe and meeke, ſo is alſo the language and ſtile. And yet peraduenture not altogether ſo, but that euery mans ſtile is for the moſt part according to the matter and ſubiect of the writer, or ſo ought to be, and conformable thereunto. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe may it be ſaid as wel, that men doo chuſe their ſubiects according to the mettal of their minds, &amp; therfore a high minded man chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him high &amp; lofty matter to write of. The baſe courage, matter baſe &amp; lowe, the meane &amp; modeſt mind, meane &amp; moderate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after the rate. Howſoeuer it be, we finde that vnder theſe three principall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (if I may with leaue ſo terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) high, meane and baſe ſtile, there be contained many other humors or qualities of ſtile, as the plaine and obſcure, the rough and ſmoth, the facill and hard, the plentifull and barraine, the rude and eloquent, the ſtrong and feeble, the vehement and cold ſtiles, all which in their euill are to be reformed, and the good to be kept and vſed. But generally to haue the ſtile decent &amp; comely it behooueth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or Poet to follow the nature of his ſubiect, that is if his matter be high and loftie that the ſtile be ſo to, if meane, the ſtile alſo to be meane, if baſe, the ſtile humble and baſe accordingly: and they that do otherwiſe vſe it, applying to meane matter, hie and loftie ſtile, and to hie matters, ſtile eyther meane or baſe, and to the baſe matters, the meane or hie ſtile, do vtterly diſgrace their poeſie and ſhew themſelues nothing skilfull in their arte, nor hauing regard
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11025:65"/>
to the decencie, which is the chiefe praiſe of any writer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ridde all louers of learning from that errour, I will as neere as I can ſet downe, which matters be hie and loftie, which be but meane, and which be low and baſe, to the intent the ſtiles may be faſhioned to the matters, and keepe their <hi>decorum</hi> and good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in euery reſpect: I am not ignorant that many good clerkes be contrary to mine opinion, and ſay that the loftie ſtyle may be decently vſed in a meane and baſe ſubiect &amp; contrariwiſe, which I do in parte acknowledge, but with a reaſonable qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>Homer</hi> hath ſo vſed it in his trifling worke of <hi>Batra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomyomachia:</hi> that is in his treatiſe of the warre betwixt the frogs and the mice. <hi>Virgill</hi> alſo in his <hi>bucolickes,</hi> and in his <hi>georgicks,</hi> whereof the one is counted meane, the other baſe, that is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans diſcourſes and the ſhepheards, but hereunto ſerueth a reaſon in my ſimple conceite: for firſt to that trifling poeme of <hi>Homer,</hi> though the frog and the mouſe be but litle and ridiculous beaſts, yet to treat of warre is an high ſubiect, and a thing in euery reſpect terrible and daungerous to them that it alights on: and therefore of learned dutie asketh martiall grandiloquence, if it be ſet foorth in his kind and nature of warre, euen betwixt the baſeſt creatures that can be imagined: ſo alſo is the Ante or piſmire, and they be but little creeping things, not perfect beaſts, but <hi>inſect,</hi> or wormes: yet in deſcribing their nature &amp; inſtinct, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life approching to the forme of a common-welth, and their properties not vnlike to the vertues of moſt excellent gouernors and captaines, it asketh a more maieſtie of ſpeach then would the deſcription of any other beaſtes life or nature, and perchance of many matters perteyning vnto the baſer ſort of men, becauſe it reſembleth the hiſtorie of a ciuill regiment, and of them all the chiefe and moſt principall which is <hi>Monarchie:</hi> ſo alſo in his <hi>buco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> which are but paſtorall ſpeaches and the baſeſt of any other poeme in their owne proper nature: <hi>Virgill</hi> vſed a ſomewhat ſwelling ſtile when he came to inſinuate the birth of <hi>Marcellus</hi> heire apparant to the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as child to his ſiſter, aſpiring by hope and greatnes of the houſe, to the ſucceſſion of the Empire, and eſtabliſhment thereof in that familie: whereupon <hi>Virgill</hi> could do no leſſe then to vſe ſuch manner of ſtile, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11025:66"/>
condition the poeme were of and this was decent, &amp; no fault or blemiſh, to confound the tennors of the ſtiles for that cauſe. But now when I remember me againe that this <hi>Eglogue,</hi> (for I haue read it ſomewhere) was conceiued by <hi>Octauian</hi> th'Emperour to be written to the honour of <hi>Pollio</hi> a citizen of Rome, &amp; of no great nobilitie, the ſame was miſliked againe as an implicatiue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing decent nor proportionable to <hi>Pollio</hi> his fortunes and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in which reſpect I might ſay likewiſe the ſtile was not to be ſuch as if it had bene for the Emperours owne honour, and thoſe of the bloud imperiall, then which ſubiect there could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romane</hi> writers an higher nor grauer to treat vpon: ſo can I not be remoued from mine opinion, but ſtill me thinks that in all decencie the ſtile ought to conforme with the nature of the ſubiect, otherwiſe if a writer will ſeeme to obſerue no <hi>decorum</hi> at all, nor paſſe how he faſhion his tale to his matter, who doubteth but he may in the lighteſt cauſe ſpeake like a Pope, &amp; in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt matters prate like a parrat, &amp; finde wordes &amp; phraſes ynough to ſerue both turnes, and neither of them commendably, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is all that may be written of Kings and Princes ſuch as ought to keepe a high ſtile, nor all that may be written vpon a ſhepheard to keepe the low, but according to the matter reported, if that be of high or baſe nature: for euery pety pleaſure, and vayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of a king are not to accompted high matter for the height of his eſtate, but meane and perchaunce very baſe and vile: nor ſo a Poet or hiſtoriographer, could decently with a high ſtile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte the vanities of <hi>Nero,</hi> the ribaudries of <hi>Caligula,</hi> the idlenes of <hi>Domitian,</hi> &amp; the riots of <hi>Heliogabalus.</hi> But well the magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and honorable ambition of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the proſperities of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> the grauitie of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the bountie of <hi>Traiane,</hi> the wiſedome of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and generally all that which concerned the higheſt honours of Emperours, their birth, alliaunces, gouernement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in warre and peace, and other publike affaires: for they be matter ſtately and high, and require a ſtile to be lift vp and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced by choyſe of wordes, phraſes, ſentences, and figures, high, loftie, eloquent, &amp; magnifik in proportion: ſo be the meane mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to be caried with all wordes and ſpeaches of ſmothneſſe and pleaſant moderation, &amp; finally the baſe things to be holden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               </argument>
               <p>THe matters therefore that concerne the Gods and diuine things are higheſt of all other to be couched in writing, next to them the noble geſts and great fortunes of Princes, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of time, as the greateſt affaires of war &amp; peace, theſe be all high ſubiectes, and therefore are deliuered ouer to the Poets <hi>Hymnick</hi> &amp; hiſtoricall who be occupied either in diuine laudes, or in <hi>heroicall</hi> reports: the meane matters be thoſe that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne meane men, their life and buſines, as lawyers, gentlemen, and marchants, good houſholders and honeſt Citizens, and which ſound neither to matters of ſtate nor of warre, nor leagues, nor great alliances, but ſmatch all the common conuerſation, as of the ciuiller and better ſort of men: the baſe and low matters be the doings of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> artificer, ſeruing man, yeoman, groome, husbandman, day-labourer, ſailer, ſhepheard, ſwynard, and ſuch like of homely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, degree and bringing vp: ſo that in euery of the ſayd three degrees, not the ſelfe ſame vertues be egally to be prayſed nor the ſame vices, egally to be diſpraiſed, nor their loues, mariages, quarels, contracts and other behauiours, be like high nor do require to be ſet fourth with the like ſtile: but euery one in his degree and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, which made that all <hi>hymnes</hi> and hiſtories, and Tragedies, were written in the high ſtile: all Comedies and Enterludes and other common Poeſies of loues, and ſuch like in the meane ſtile, all <hi>Eglogues</hi> and paſtorall poemes in the low and baſe ſtile, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they had bene vtterly diſproporcioned: likewiſe for the ſame cauſe ſome phraſes and figures be onely peculiar to the high ſtile, ſome to the baſe or meane, ſome common to all three, as ſhalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared more at large hereafter when we come to ſpeake of figure and phraſe: alſo ſome wordes and ſpeaches and ſentences doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the high ſtile, that do not become th'other two.

all one as if the carpenter before he began to ſquare his timber would make his ſquire crooked: in ſo much as the ſtraite and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right mind of a Iudge is the very rule of iuſtice till it be peruerted by affection. This no doubt is true and was by them grauely conſidered: but in this caſe becauſe our maker or Poet is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not for a iudge, but rather for a pleader, and that of pleaſant &amp; louely cauſes and nothing perillous, ſuch as be thoſe for the triall of life, limme, or liuelyhood; and before iudges neither ſower nor ſeuere, but in the eare of princely dames, yong ladies, gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and courtiers, beyng all for the moſt part either meeke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of pleaſant humour, and that all his abuſes tende but to diſpoſe the hearers to mirth and ſollace by pleaſant conueyance and efficacy of ſpeach, they are not in truth to be accompted vices but for vertues in the poetical ſcience very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, ſuch treſpaſſes in ſpeach (whereof there be many) as geue dolour and diſliking to the eare &amp; minde, by any foule indecencie or diſproportion of ſound, ſituation, or ſence, they be called and not without cauſe the vicious parts or rather hereſies of language: wherefore the matter reſteth much in the definition and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this word <hi>[decorum]</hi> for whatſoeuer is ſo, cannot iuſtly be miſliked. In which reſpect it may come to paſſe that what the Grammarian ſetteth downe for a vicioſitee in ſpeach may become a vertue and no vice, contrariwiſe his commended figure may fall into a reprochfull fault: the beſt and moſt aſſured remedy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, generally to follow the ſaying of <hi>Bias: ne quid nimis.</hi> So as in keeping meaſure, and not exceeding nor ſhewing any defect in the vſe of his figures, he cannot lightly do amiſſe, if he haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (as that muſt needes be) a ſpeciall regard to all circumſtances of the perſon, place, time, cauſe and purpoſe he hath in hand, which being well obſerued it eaſily auoideth all the recited inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and maketh now and then very vice goe for a formall vertue in the exerciſe of this Arte.</p>

that the bewtie and good grace of vtterance reſted in no many pointes: and whatſoeuer tranſgreſſed thoſe lymits, they counted it for vitious; and thereupon did ſet downe a manner of regiment in all ſpeech generally to be obſerued, conſiſting in ſixe pointes.

                  <p>How the Greeks first, and afterward the Latines, inuented new names for euery figure, which this Author is alſo enforced to doo in his vulgar.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Greekes were a happy people for the freedome &amp; liberty of their language, becauſe it was allowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t any new name that they liſted and to peece many words together to make of them one entire, much more ſignificatiue than the ſingle word. So among other things did they to their figuratiue ſpeeches deuiſe certaine names. The Latines came ſomewhat behind them in that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11025:68"/>
point, and for want of conuenient ſingle wordes to expreſſe that which the Greeks could do by cobling many words together, they were faine to vſe the Greekes ſtill, till after many yeares that the learned Oratours and good Grammarians among the Romaines, as <hi>Cicero, Varro, Quintilian,</hi> &amp; others ſtrained themſelues to giue the Greeke wordes Latin names, and yet nothing ſo apt and fitty. The ſame courſe are we driuen to follow in this deſcription, ſince we are enforced to cull out for the vſe of our Poet or maker all the moſt commendable figures. Now to make them knowen (as behoueth) either we muſt do it by th'originall Greeke name or by the Latine, or by our owne. But when I conſider to what ſort of Readers I write, &amp; how ill faring the Greeke terme would ſound in the Engliſh eare, then alſo how ſhort the Latines come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe manie of the Greeke originals. Finally, how well our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſerueth to ſupplie the full ſignification of them both, I haue thought it no leſſe lawfull, yea peraduenture vnder licence of the learned, more laudable to vſe our owne naturall, if they be well choſen, and of proper ſignification, than to borrow theirs. So ſhall not our Engliſh Poets, though they be to ſeeke of the Greeke and Latin languages, lament for lack of knowledge ſufficient to the purpoſe of this arte. And in caſe any of theſe new Engliſh names giuen by me to any figure, ſhall happen to offend. I pray that the learned will beare with me and to thinke the ſtraungeneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceedes but of noueltie and diſaquaintance with our eares, which in proceſſe of tyme, and by cuſtome will frame very well: and ſuch others as are not learned in the primitiue languages, if they happen to hit vpon any new name of myne (ſo ridiculous in their opinion) as may moue them to laughter, let ſuch perſons, yet aſſure themſelues that ſuch names go as neare as may be to their originals, or els ſerue better to the purpoſe of the figure then the very originall, reſeruing alwayes, that ſuch new name ſhould not be vnpleaſant in our vulgar nor harſh vpon the tong: and where it ſhall happen otherwiſe, that it may pleaſe the reader to thinke that hardly any other name in our Engliſh could be found to ſerue the turne better. Againe if to auoid the hazard of this blame I ſhould haue kept the Greek or Latin ſtill it would haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a little too ſcholaſticall for our makers, and a peece of worke
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11025:69"/>
more fit for clerkes then for Courtiers for whoſe inſtruction this trauaile is taken: and if I ſhould haue left out both the Greeke and Latine name, and put in none of our owne neither: well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance might the rule of the figure haue bene ſet downe, but no conuenient name to hold him in memory. It was therfore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient we deuiſed for euery figure of importance his vulgar name, and to ioyne the Greeke or Latine originall with them; after that ſort much better ſatisfying aſwel the vulgar as the learned learner, and alſo the authors owne purpoſe, which is to make of a ruderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a learned and a Courtly Poet.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A diuiſion of figures, and how they ſerue in exornation of language.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd becauſe our chiefe purpoſe herein is for the learning of Ladies and young Gentlewomen, or idle Courtiers, deſirous to become skilful in their owne mother tongue, and for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate recreation to make now &amp; then ditties of pleaſure, thinking for our parte none other ſcience ſo fit for them &amp; the place as that which teacheth <hi>beau</hi> ſemblant, the chiefe profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwell of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as of poeſie: ſince to ſuch manner of mindes nothing is more comberſome then tedious doctrines and ſchollarly methodes of diſcipline, we haue in our owne conceit deuiſed a new and ſtrange modell of this arte, fitter to pleaſe the Court then the ſchoole, and yet not vnneceſſarie for all ſuch as be willing themſelues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good makers in the vulgar, or to be able to iudge of other mens makings: wherefore, intending to follow the courſe which we haue begun, thus we ſay: that though the language of our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et or maker be pure and clenly, and not diſgraced by ſuch vicious parts as haue bene before remembred in the Chapter of language, be ſufficiently pleaſing and commendable for the ordinarie vſe of ſpeech; yet is not the ſame ſo well appointed for all purpoſes of the excellent Poet, as when it is galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly arrayed in all his colours which figure can ſet vpon it, therefore we are now further to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of figures and figuratiue ſpeeches. Figuratiue ſpeech is a noueltie of language euidently (and yet not abſurdly) eſtranged from the ordinarie habite and manner of our dayly talke and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11025:69"/>
and figure it ſelfe is a certaine liuely or good grace ſet vpon wordes, ſpeaches and ſentences to ſome purpoſe and not in vaine, giuing them ornament or efficacie by many maner of alterations in ſhape, in ſounde, and alſo in ſence, ſometime by way of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage, ſometime by defect, ſometime by diſorder, or mutation, &amp; alſo by putting into our ſpeaches more pithe and ſubſtance, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie, quickneſſe, efficacie or moderation, in this or that ſort tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and tempring them, by amplification, abridgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, opening, cloſing, enforcing, meekening or otherwiſe diſpoſing them to the beſt purpoſe: whereupon the learned clerks who haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically of this Arte in the two maſter languages, Greeke and Latine, haue ſorted all their figures into three rankes, and the firſt they beſtowed vpon the Poet onely: the ſecond vpon the Poet and Oratour indifferently: the third vpon the Oratour alone. And that firſt ſort of figures doth ſerue th'eare onely and may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Auricular:</hi> your ſecond ſerues the conceit onely and not th'eare, and may be called <hi>ſenſable,</hi> not ſenſible nor yet ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: your third ſort ſerues as well th'eare as the conceit and may be called <hi>ſententious figures,</hi> becauſe not only they properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to full ſentences, for bewtifying them with a currant &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant numeroſitie, but alſo giuing them efficacie, and enlarging the whole matter beſides with copious amplifications. I doubt not but ſome buſie carpers will ſcorne at my new deuiſed termes: <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular</hi> and <hi>ſenſable,</hi> ſaying that I might with better warrant haue vſed in their ſteads theſe words, <hi>orthographicall</hi> or <hi>ſyntacticall,</hi> which the learned Grammarians left ready made to our hands, and do importe as much as th'other that I haue brought, which thing peraduenture I deny not in part, and neuertheleſſe for ſome cauſes thought them not ſo neceſſarie: but with theſe maner of men I do willingly beare, in reſpect of their laudable endeuour to allow antiquitie and flie innouation: with like beneuolence I truſt they will beare with me writing in the vulgar ſpeach and ſeeking by my nouelties to ſatisfie not the ſchoole but the Court: whereas they know very well all old things ſoone waxe ſtale &amp; lothſome, and the new deuiſes are euer dainty and delicate, the vulgar inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction requiring alſo vulgar and communicable termes, not clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or vncouthe as are all theſe of the Greeke and Latine languages
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11025:70"/>
primitiuely receiued, vnleſſe they be qualified or by much vſe and cuſtome allowed and our eares made acquainted with them. Thus then I ſay that <hi>auricular</hi> figures be thoſe which worke alteration in th'eare by ſound, accent, time, and ſlipper volubilitie in vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſuch as for that reſpect was called by the auncients numero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of ſpeach. And not onely the whole body of a tale in poeme or hiſtorie may be made in ſuch ſort pleaſant and agreable to the eare, but alſo euery clauſe by it ſelfe, and euery ſingle word carried in a clauſe, may haue their pleaſant ſweeteneſſe apart. And ſo long as this qualitie extendeth but to the outward tuning of the ſpeach reaching no higher then th'eare and forcing the mynde little or nothing, it is that vertue which the Greeks call <hi>Enargia</hi> and is the office of the <hi>auricular</hi> figures to performe. Therefore as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of language at large are whole ſentences, and ſentences are compact of clauſes, and clauſes of words, and euery word of letters and ſillables, ſo is the alteration (be it but of a ſillable or letter) much materiall to the ſound and ſweeteneſſe of vtterance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beginning firſt at the ſmalleſt alterations which reſt in letters and ſillables, the firſt ſort of our figures <hi>auricular</hi> we do appoint to ſingle words as they lye in language; the ſecond to clauſes of ſpeach; the third to perfit ſentences and to the whole maſſe or body of the tale be it poeme or hiſtorie written or reported.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Word as he lieth in courſe of language is many wayes figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and thereby not a little altered in ſound, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alters the tune and harmonie of a meeter as to the eare.

               </argument>
               <p>AS your ſingle words may be many waies tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfigured to make the meetre or verſe more tunable and melodious, ſo alſo may

your whole and entire clauſes be in ſuch ſort contriued by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their conſtruction as the eare may receiue a certaine recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although the mind for any noueltie of ſence be little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affected.

And firſt of thoſe that worke by defect, if but one word or ſome little portion of ſpeach be wanting, it may be ſupplied by ordinary vnderſtanding and vertue of the figure <hi>Eclipſis,</hi>

And firſt, ſingle words haue their ſence and vnderſtanding altered and figured many wayes, to wit, by tranſport, abuſe, croſſe-naming, new naming, change of name. This will ſeeme very darke to you, vnleſſe it be otherwiſe explaned more particularly:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Metaphora,</hi> or the Figure of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporte.</note> and firſt of <hi>Tranſport.</hi> There is a kinde of wreſting of a ſingle word from his owne right ſignification, to another not ſo naturall, but yet of ſome affinitie or conueniencie with it, as to ſay, <hi>I cannot digeſt your vnkinde words,</hi> for I cannot take them in good part: or as the man of law ſaid, <hi>I feele you not,</hi> for I vnderſtand not your caſe, becauſe he had not his fee in his hand. Or as another ſaid to a mouthy Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>why barkeſt thou at me ſo ſore?</hi> Or to call the top of a tree, or of a hill, the crowne of a tree or of a hill: for in deede <hi>crowne</hi> is the higheſt ornament of a Princes head, made like a cloſe garland, or els the top of a mans head, where the haire windes about, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch terme is not applyed naturally to a tree, or to a hill, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11025:77"/>
is tranſported from a mans head to a hill or tree, therefore it is called by <hi>metaphore,</hi> or the figure of <hi>tranſport.</hi> And three cauſes moues vs to vſe this figure, one for neceſſitie or want of a better word, thus:
<q>
                     <l>As the drie ground that thirſtes after a ſhowr</l>

               <p>Here for want of an apter and more naturall word to declare the drie temper of the earth, it is ſaid to thirſt &amp; to reioyce, which is onely proper to liuing creatures, and yet being ſo inuerted, doth not ſo much ſwerue from the true ſence, but that euery man can eaſilie conceiue the meaning thereof.</p>
               <p>Againe, we vſe it for pleaſure and ornament of our ſpeach, as thus in an Epitaph of our owne making, to the honourable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of a deere friend, Sir <hi>Iohn Throgmorton,</hi> knight, Iuſtice of Cheſter, and a man of many commendable vertues.</p>

               <p>Then alſo do we it ſometimes to enforce a ſence and make the word more ſignificatiue: as thus,

               </argument>
               <p>AS by the laſt remembred figures the ſence of ſingle wordes is altered, ſo by theſe that follow is that of whole and entier ſpeach: and firſt by the Courtly figure <hi>Allegoria,</hi> which is when we ſpeake one thing and thinke another, and that our wordes and our meanings meete not. The vſe of this figure is ſo large, and his vertue of ſo great efficacie as it is ſuppoſed no man can pleaſantly vtter and perſwade without it, but in effect is ſure neuer or very ſeldome to thriue and proſper in the world, that cannot skilfully put in vre, in ſomuch as not onely euery common Courtier, but alſo the graueſt Counſellour, yea and the moſt noble and wiſeſt Prince of them all are many times enforced to vſe it, by example (ſay they) of the great Emperour who had it vſually in his mouth to ſay, <hi>Qui neſcit diſſimulare neſcit regnare.</hi> Of this figure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which for his duplicitie we call the figure of <hi>[falſe ſemblant or diſſimulation]</hi> we will ſpeake firſt as of the chief ringleader and captaine of all other figures, either in the Poeticall or orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſcience.</p>
               <p>And ye ſhall know that we may diſſemble,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Allegoria,</hi> or the Figure of falſe ſemblant.</note> I meane ſpeake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then we thinke, in earneſt aſwell as in ſport, vnder couert and darke termes, and in learned and apparant ſpeaches, in ſhort ſentences, and by long ambage and circumſtance of wordes, and finally aſwell when we lye as when we tell truth. To be ſhort eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpeach wreſted from his owne naturall ſignification to another not altogether ſo naturall is a kinde of diſſimulation, becauſe the wordes beare contrary countenaunce to th'intent. But properly &amp; in his principall vertue <hi>Allegoria</hi> is when we do ſpeake in ſence tranſlatiue and wreſted from the owne ſignification, neuertheleſſe applied to another not altogether contrary, but hauing much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniencie with it as before we ſaid of the metaphore: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample if we ſhould call the common wealth, a ſhippe; the Prince a Pilot, the Counſellours mariners, the ſtormes warres, the calme
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11025:81"/>
and <hi>[hauen]</hi> peace, this is ſpoken all in allegorie: and becauſe ſuch inuerſion of ſence in one ſingle worde is by the figure <hi>Metaphore,</hi> of whom we ſpake before, and this manner of inuerſion exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whole and large ſpeaches, it maketh the figure <hi>allegorie</hi> to be called a long and perpetuall Metaphore.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Meaning, that her loue was ſo ſtedfaſt and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant toward him as no time or occaſion could alter it. <hi>

For if the thing or perſon they go about to deſcribe by circumſtance, be by the writers improuidence otherwiſe bewrayed, it looſeth the grace of a figure, as he that ſaid:

               <p>Intending to deſcribe the ſpring of the yeare, which euery man knoweth of himſelfe, hearing the day of March named: the verſes be very good the figure nought worth, if it were meant in Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, for the matter, that is the ſeaſon of the yeare which ſhould haue bene couertly diſcloſed by ambage, was by and by blabbed out by naming the day of the moneth, &amp; ſo the purpoſe of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure diſapointed, peraduenture it had bin better to haue ſaid thus:

               <p>For now there remaineth for the Reader ſomewhat to ſtudie and geſſe vpon, and yet the ſpring time to the learned iudgement ſufficiently expreſſed.</p>
               <p>The Noble Earle of Surrey wrote thus:
<q>

               </p>
               <p>I would faine learne of ſome good maker, whether the Earle ſpake this in figure of <hi>Periphraſe</hi> or not, for mine owne opinion I thinke that if he ment to deſcribe the winter ſeaſon, he would not haue diſcloſed it ſo broadly, as to ſay winter at the firſt worde, for that had bene againſt the rules of arte, and without any good iudgement: which in ſo learned &amp; excellent a perſonage we ought not to ſuſpect, we ſay therefore that for winter it is no <hi>Periphraſe</hi> but language at large: we ſay for all that, hauing regard to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe that followeth it is a <hi>Periphraſe,</hi> ſeeming that thereby he intended to ſhew in what part of the winter his loues gaue him anguiſh, that is in the time which we call the fall of the leafe, which begins in the moneth of October, and ſtands very well with the figure to be vttered in that ſort notwithſtanding winter be named before, for winter hath many parts: ſuch namely as do not ſhake of the leafe, nor vncloth the trees as here is mencioned: thus may ye iudge as I do, that this noble Erle wrate excellently well and to purpoſe. Moreouer, when a maker will ſeeme to vſe circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſet forth any thing pleaſantly and figuratiuely, yet no leſſe plaine to a ripe reader, then if it were named expreſly, and when all is done, no man can perceyue it to be the thing intended. This is a foule ouerſight in any writer as did a good fellow, who weening to ſhew his cunning, would needs by periphraſe expreſſe the realme of Scotland in no leſſe then eight verſes, and when he had ſaid all, no man could imagine it to be ſpoken of Scotland: and did beſides many other faults in his verſe, ſo deadly belie the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by his deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it would pitie any good maker to heare it.</p>

For the eare is properly but an inſtrument of conueyance for the minde, to apprehend the ſence by the ſound. And our ſpeech is made me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious or harmonicall, not onely by ſtrayned tunes, as thoſe of <hi>Muſick,</hi> but alſo by choiſe of ſmoothe words: and thus, or thus, marſhalling them in their comelieſt conſtruction and order, and aſwell by ſometimes ſparing, ſometimes ſpending them more or leſſe liberally, and carrying or tranſporting of them farther off or neerer, ſetting them with ſundry relations, and variable formes, in the miniſtery and vſe of words, doe breede no little alteration in man. For to ſay truely, what els is man but his minde? which, whoſoeuer haue skil to compaſſe, and make yeelding and flexible, what may not he commaund the body to perfourme? He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath vanquiſhed the minde of man, hath made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt glorious conqueſt.

Therefore the well tuning of your words and clauſes to the delight of the eare, maketh your information no leſſe plauſible to the minde than to the eare: no though you filled them with neuer ſo much ſence and ſententiouſnes. Then alſo muſt the whole tale (if it tende to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion) beare his iuſt and reaſonable meaſure, being rather with the largeſt, than with the ſcarceſt. For like as one or two drops of water perce not the flint ſtone, but many and often droppings doo: ſo cannot a few words (be they neuer ſo pithie or ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) in all caſes and to all manner of mindes, make ſo deepe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as a more multitude of words to the purpoſe diſcreetely, and without ſuperfluitie vttered: the minde being no leſſe vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

               <p>The Greekes call this figure <hi>Antiſtrophe,</hi> the Latines, <hi>conuerſio,</hi> I following the originall call him the <hi>counterturne,</hi> becauſe he turnes counter in the middeſt of euery meetre.</p>
               <p>Take me the two former figures and put them into one, and it is that which the Greekes call <hi>ſymploche,</hi> the Latines <hi>complexio,</hi> or <hi>conduplicatio,</hi>

               <p>The Greekes name this figure <hi>Symploche,</hi> the Latins <hi>Complexio,</hi> perchaunce for that he ſeemes to hold in and to wrap vp the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by reduplication, ſo as nothing can fall out. I had rather call him the figure of replie.</p>

in our vulgar and for pleaſure call him the <hi>cuckowſpell,</hi> for right as the cuckow repeats his lay, which is but one manner of note, and doth not inſert any other tune betwixt, and ſometimes for haſt ſtammers out two or three of them one immediatly after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as <hi>cuck, cuck, cuckow,</hi> ſo doth the figure <hi>Epizeuxis</hi> in the former verſes, <hi>Maryne, Maryne,</hi> without any intermiſſion at all.</p>

                     <hi>Ploche,</hi> or the Doubler.</note>Yet haue ye one ſorte of repetition, which we call the <hi>doubler,</hi> and is as the next before, a ſpeedie iteration of one word, but with ſome little intermiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by inſerting one or two words betweene, as in a moſt excellent dittie written by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> theſe two cloſing verſes:

               </q>
               <p>Or as we once ſported vpon a fellowes name who was called <hi>Woodcock,</hi> and for an ill part he had plaid entreated fauour by his friend.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I praie you intreate no more for the man,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Now alſo be there many other ſortes of repetition if a man would vſe them, but are nothing commendable, and therefore are not obſerued in good poeſie, as a vulgar rimer who doubled one word in the end of euery verſe, thus:
<q>
                     <l>adieu, adieu,</l>
                     <l>my face, my face.</l>

                     <hi>Proſonomaſia,</hi> or the Nicknamer.</note>Ye haue a figure by which ye play with a couple of words or names much reſembling, and becauſe the one ſeemes to anſwere

th'other by manner of illuſion, and doth, as it were, nick him, I call him the <hi>Nicknamer.</hi> If any other man can geue him a fitter Engliſh name, I will not be angrie, but I am ſure mine is very neere the originall ſence of <hi>Proſonomaſia,</hi> and is rather a by-name geuen in ſport, than a ſurname geuen of any earneſt purpoſe. As, <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, becauſe he was a great drinker of wine, they called him by way of deriſion to his owne name, <hi>Caldius Biberius Mero,</hi> in ſteade of <hi>Claudius Tiberius Nero:</hi> and ſo a ieſting frier that wrate againſt <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> called him by reſemblance to his own name, <hi>Errans mus,</hi> and are mainteined by this figure <hi>Proſonomaſia,</hi> or the Nicknamer. But euery name geuen in ieſt or by way of a ſurname, if it do not reſemble the true, is not by this figure, as, the Emperor of Greece, who was ſurnamed <hi>Conſtantinus C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> in a dittie plaide very pretily with theſe two words, <hi>Loue and liue,</hi> thus.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here ye ſee how in the former rime this word life is tranlaced into liue, liuing, liuely, liuelode: &amp; in the latter rime this word wit is tranſlated into weete, weene, wotte, witleſſe, witty &amp; wiſe: which come all from one originall.</p>

               <p>And thus againe, It hath bene alwayes vſuall among great and magnanimous princes in all ages, not only to repulſe any iniury &amp; inuaſion from their owne realmes and dominions, but alſo with a charitable &amp; Princely compaſſion to defend their good neighbors Princes and Potentats, from all oppreſſion of tyrants &amp; vſurpers. So did the Romaines by their armes reſtore many Kings of Aſia and Affricke expulſed out of their kingdoms.

               <p>IT hath bene ſaid before how by ignorance of the maker a good figure may become a vice, and by his good diſcretion, a vicious ſpeach go for a vertue in the Poeticall ſcience. This ſaying is to be explaned and qualified, for ſome maner of ſpeaches are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes intolerable and ſuch as cannot be vſed with any decencie, but are euer vndecent namely barbarouſneſſe, incongruitie, ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, fond affectation, ruſticitie, and all extreme darkneſſe, ſuch as it is not poſſible for a man to vnderſtand the matter without an interpretour, all which partes are generally to be baniſhed out of euery language, vnleſſe it may appeare that the maker or Poet do it for the nonce, as it was reported by the Philoſopher <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that he wrote in obſcure and darke termes of purpoſe not to be vnderſtood, whence he merited the nickname <hi>Scotinus,</hi> otherwiſe I ſee not but the reſt of the common faultes may be borne with

ſometimes, or paſſe without any great reproofe, not being vſed ouermuch or out of ſeaſon as I ſaid before: ſo as euery ſurpluſage or prepoſterous placing or vndue iteration or darke word, or doubtfull ſpeach are not ſo narrowly to be looked vpon in a large poeme, nor ſpecially in the pretie Poeſies and deuiſes of Ladies, and Gentlewomen makers, whom we would not haue too preciſe Poets leaſt with their ſhrewd wits, when they were maried they might become a little too phantaſticall wiues, neuertheleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſeem to promiſe an arte, which doth not iuſtly admit any wilful errour in the teacher, and to th'end we may not be carped at by theſe methodicall men, that we haue omitted any neceſſary point in this buſineſſe to be regarded, I will ſpeake ſomewhat touching theſe vicioſities of language particularly and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leauing no little to the Grammarians for maintenaunce of the ſcholaſticall warre, and altercations: we for our part condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this deuiſe of ours, to the appetite of Princely perſonages &amp; other ſo tender &amp; queſie complexions in Court, as are annoyed with nothing more then long leſſons and ouermuch good order.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Some vices in ſpeaches and vvriting are alwayes intollerable, ſome others now and then borne vvithall by licence of approued authors and custome.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe fouleſt vice in language is to ſpeake barbarouſly: this terme grew by the great pride of the Greekes and Latines,<note place="margin">

The Italian at this day by like arrogance calleth the Frenchman, Spaniard, Dutch, Engliſh, and all other breed behither their mountaines <hi>Appennines,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:11025:108"/>
Tramontani,</hi> as who would ſay Barbarous. This terme being then ſo vſed by the auncient Greekes, there haue bene ſince, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding who haue digged for the Etimologie ſomewhat deeper, and many of them haue ſaid that it was ſpoken by the rude and barking language of the Affricans now called Barbarians, who had great trafficke with the Greekes and Romanes, but that can not be ſo, for that part of Affricke hath but of late receiued the name of Burbarie, and ſome others rather thinke that of this word Barbarous, that countrey came to be called <hi>Barbaria</hi> and but few yeares in reſpect agone. Others among whom is <hi>Ihan Leon</hi> a Moore of <hi>Granada,</hi> will ſeeme to deriue <hi>Barbaria,</hi> from this word <hi>Bar,</hi> twiſe iterated thus <hi>Barbar,</hi> as much to ſay as flye, flye, which chaunced in a perſecution of the Arabians by ſome ſeditious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanes in the time of their Pontif. <hi>Habdul mumi,</hi> when they were had in the chaſe, &amp; driuen out of Arabia Weſtward into the countreys of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> &amp; during the purſuite cried one vpon another flye away, flye away, or paſſe paſſe, by which occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay, when the Arabians which were had in chaſe came to ſtay and ſettle them ſelues in that part of Affrica, they called it <hi>Barbar,</hi> as much to ſay, the region of their flight or purſuite.

<q>
                     <l>And if I not performe, God let me neuer thriue.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For performe not: and this vice is ſometime tollerable inough, but if the word carry any notable ſence, it is a vice not tollerable, as he that ſaid praiſing a woman for her red lippes, thus:
<q>
                     <l>A corrall lippe of hew.</l>
                  </q>

               <p>Which is no good ſpeech, becauſe either he ſhould haue ſayd no more but a corrall lip, which had bene inough to declare the redneſſe, or els he ſhould haue ſaid, a lip of corrall hew, and not a corrall lip of hew.

               <p>IN all things to vſe decencie, is it onely that giueth euery thing his good grace &amp; without which nothing in mans ſpeach could ſeeme good or gracious, in ſo much as many times it makes a bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull figure fall into a deformitie, and on th'other ſide a vicious ſpeach ſeeme pleaſaunt and bewtifull: this decencie is therfore the line &amp; leuell for al good makers to do their buſines by.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:11025:112"/>
as for example, when a ſound is either too loude or too low or otherwiſe confuſe, the eare is ill affected: ſo is th'eye if the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be ſad or not liminous and recreatiue, or the ſhape of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred body without his due meaſures and ſimmetry, and the like of euery other ſence in his proper function.

               <p>Now becauſe this comelyneſſe reſteth in the good conformitie of many things and their ſundry circumſtances, with reſpect one to another, ſo as there be found a iuſt correſpondencie betweene them by this or that relation, the Greekes call it <hi>Analogie</hi> or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient proportion.

But by reaſon of the ſundry circumſtances, that mans affaires are as it were wrapt in, this <hi>[decencie]</hi> comes to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much alterable and ſubiect to varietie, in ſo much as our ſpeach asketh one maner of <hi>decencie,</hi> in reſpect of the perſon who ſpeakes: another of his to whom it is ſpoken: another of whom we ſpeake: another of what we ſpeake, and in what place and time and to what purpoſe. And as it is of ſpeach, ſo of al other our behauiours. We wil therefore ſet you down ſome few examples of euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance how it alters the decencie of ſpeach or action. And
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11025:113"/>
by theſe few ſhal ye be able to gather a number more to confirme and eſtabliſh your iudgement by a perfit diſcretion.</p>
               <p>This decencie, ſo farfoorth as apperteineth to the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our art, reſteth in writing, ſpeech and behauiour. But becauſe writing is no more then the image or character of ſpeech, they ſhall goe together in theſe our obſeruations. And firſt wee wil ſort you out diuers points, in which the wiſe and learned men of times paſt haue noted much decency or vndecencie, euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his diſcretion, as it hath bene ſaid afore: but wherein for the moſt part all diſcreete men doe generally agree, and varie not in opinion, whereof the examples I will geue you be worthie of remembrance: &amp; though they brought with them no doctrine or inſtitution at all, yet for the ſolace they may geue the readers, after ſuch a rable of ſcholaſtical precepts which be tedious, theſe reports being of the nature of matters hiſtoricall, they are to be embraced: but olde memories are very profitable to the mind, and ſerue as a glaſſe to looke vpon and behold the euents of time, and more exactly to skan the trueth of euery caſe that ſhall happen in the affaires of man, and many there be that haply doe not obſerue euery particularitie in matters of decencie or vndecencie: and yet when the caſe is tolde them by another man, they commonly geue the ſame ſentence vpon it. But yet whoſoeuer obſerueth much, ſhalbe counted the wiſeſt and diſcreeteſt man, and whoſoeuer ſpends all his life in his owne vaine actions and conceits, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues no mans elſe, he ſhal in the ende prooue but a ſimple man. In which reſpect it is alwaies ſaid, one man of experience is wiſer than tenne learned men, becauſe of his long and ſtudious obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and often triall.</p>
               <p>And your decencies are of ſundrie ſorts, according to the many circumſtances accompanying our writing, ſpeech or behauiour, ſo as in the very ſound or voice of him that ſpeaketh, there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie that becommeth, and an vndecencie that misbeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vs, which th'Emperor <hi>Anthonine</hi> marked well in the Orator <hi>Philiſeus,</hi> who ſpake before him with ſo ſmall and ſhrill a voice as the Emperor was greatly annoyed therewith, and to make him ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his tale, ſaid, by thy beard thou ſhouldſt be a man, but by thy voice a woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:11025:114"/>
                  <hi>Phauorinus</hi> the Philoſopher was counted very wiſe and well learned, but a little too talkatiue and full of words: for the which <hi>Timocrates</hi> reprooued him in the hearing of one <hi>Polemon.</hi> That is no wonder quoth <hi>Polemon,</hi> for ſo be all women. And beſides, <hi>Phauorinus</hi> being knowen for an Eunuke or gelded man, came by the ſame nippe to be noted as an effeminate and degenerate perſon.</p>
               <p>And there is a meaſure to be vſed in a mans ſpeech or tale, ſo as it be neither for ſhortneſſe too darke, nor for length too tedious. Which made <hi>Cleomenes</hi> king of the Lacedemonians geue this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant anſwere to the Ambaſſadors of the Samiens, who had tolde him a long meſſage from their Citie, and deſired to know his pleaſure in it. My maiſters (ſaith he) the firſt part of your tale was ſo long, that I remember it not, which made that the ſecond I vnderſtoode not, and as for the third part I doe nothing well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of. Great princes and graue counſellers who haue little ſpare leiſure to hearken, would haue ſpeeches vſed to them ſuch as be ſhort and ſweete.</p>
               <p>And if they be ſpoken by a man of account, or one who for his yeares, profeſſion or dignitie ſhould be thought wiſe &amp; reuerend, his ſpeeches &amp; words ſhould alſo be graue, pithie &amp; ſententious, which was well noted by king <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who likened <hi>Hermoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the famous Orator of Greece, vnto theſe fowles in their moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time, when their feathers be ſick, and be ſo loaſe in the fleſh that at any little rowſe they can eaſilie ſhake them off: ſo ſaith he, can <hi>Hermogenes</hi> of all the men that euer I knew, as eaſilie deliuer from him his vaine and impertinent ſpeeches and words.</p>
               <p>And there is a decencie, that euery ſpeech ſhould be to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and delight, or dignitie of the hearer &amp; not for any reſpect arrogant or vndutifull, as was that of <hi>Alexander</hi> ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from the <hi>Athenians</hi> to th'Emperour <hi>Marcus,</hi> this man ſeing th'emperour not ſo attentiue to his tale, as he would haue had him, ſaid by way of interruption, <hi>Caeſar</hi> I pray thee giue me better eare, it ſeemeſt thou knoweſt me not, nor from whom I came: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour nothing well liking his bold malapert ſpeech, ſaid: thou art deceyued, for I heare thee and know well inough, that thou art that fine, fooliſh, curious, ſawcie <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> that tendeſt to nothing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:11025:114"/>
but to combe &amp; cury thy haire, to pare thy nailes, to pick thy teeth, and to perfume thy ſelfe with ſweet oyles, that no man may abide the ſent of thee. Prowde ſpeeches, and too much fineſſe and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie is not commendable in an Embaſſadour. And I haue knowen in my time ſuch of them, as ſtudied more vpon what apparell they ſhould weare, and what countenaunces they ſhould keepe at the times of their audience, then they did vpon th'effect of their errant or commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And there is dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould talke of the things they haue beſt skill of, and not in that, their knowledge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſerueth them not to do, as we are wont to ſay, he ſpeaketh of Robin hood that neuer ſhot in his bow: there came a great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour before <hi>Cleomenes</hi> king of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> and vttered much matter to him touching fortitude and valiancie in the warres: the king laughed: why laugheſt thou quoth the learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince thou art a king thy ſelfe, and one whom fortitude beſt becommeth? why ſaid <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would it not make any body laugh, to heare the ſwallow who feeds onely vpon flies, to boaſt of his great pray, and ſee the eagle ſtand by and ſay nothing? if thou wert a man of warre or euer hadſt bene day of thy life, I would not laugh to here thee ſpeake of valiancie, but neuer being ſo, &amp; ſpeaking before an old captaine I can not chooſe but laugh.</p>
               <p>And ſome things and ſpeaches are decent or indecent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the time they be ſpoken or done in. As when a great clerk preſented king <hi>Antiochus</hi> with a booke treating all of iuſtice, the king that time lying at the ſiege of a towne, who lookt vpon the title of the booke, and caſt it to him againe: ſaying, what a diuell telleſt thou to me of iuſtice, now thou ſeeſt me vſe force and do the beſt I can to bereeue mine enimie of his towne? euery thing hath his ſeaſon which is called Oportunitie, and the vnfitneſſe or vndecency of the time is called Importunitie.</p>
               <p>Sometime the vndeceny ariſeth by the indignitie of the word in reſpect of the ſpeaker himſelfe, as whan a daughter of Fraunce and next heyre generall to the crowne (if the law <hi>Salique</hi> had not barred her) being ſet in a great chaufe by ſome harde words giuen her by another prince of the bloud, ſaid in her anger, thou durſt not haue ſaid thus much to me if God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me a paire of, &amp;c.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:11025:115"/>
and told all out, meaning if God had made her a man and not a woman ſhe had bene king of Fraunce. The word became not the greatneſſe of her perſon, and much leſſe her ſex, whoſe chiefe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſhamefaſtneſſe, which the Latines call <hi>Verecundia,</hi> that is a naturall feare to be noted with any impudicitie: ſo as when they heare or ſee any thing tending that way they commonly bluſh, &amp; is a part greatly praiſed in all women.</p>
               <p>Yet will ye ſee in many caſes how pleaſant ſpeeches and ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome skurrillity and vnſhamefaſtnes haue now and then a certaine decencie, and well become both the ſpeaker to ſay, and the hearer to abide, but that is by reaſon of ſome other circumſtance, as when the ſpeaker himſelfe is knowne to be a common ieſter or buffon, ſuch as take vpon them to make princes merry, or when ſome occaſion is giuen by the hearer to induce ſuch a pleaſaunt ſpeach, and in many other caſes whereof no generall rule can be giuen, but are beſt knowen by example: as when Sir <hi>Andrew Flamock</hi> king <hi>Henry</hi> the eights ſtanderdbearer, a merry conceyted man and apt to skoffe, waiting one day at the kings heeles when he entred the parke at Greenewich, the king blew his horne, <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock</hi> hauing his belly full, and his tayle at commaundement, gaue out a rappe nothing faintly, that the king turned him about and ſaid how now ſirra? <hi>Flamock</hi> not well knowing how to excuſe his vnmanerly act, if it pleaſe you Sir quoth he, your Maieſty blew one blaſt for the keeper and I another for his man. The king laughed hartily and tooke it nothing offenſiuely: for indeed as the caſe fell out it was not vndecently ſpoken by Sir <hi>Andrew Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock,</hi> for it was the cleanelieſt excuſe he could make, and a merry implicatiue in termes nothing odious, and therefore a ſporting ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the kings mind, in a matter which without ſome ſuch merry anſwere could not haue bene well taken. So was <hi>Flamocks</hi> action moſt vncomely, but his ſpeech excellently well beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming the occaſion.</p>
               <p>But at another time and in another like caſe, the ſame skurril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of <hi>Flamock</hi> was more offenſiue, becauſe it was more indecent. As when the king hauing <hi>Flamock</hi> with him in his barge, paſſing from Weſtminſter to Greenewich to viſite a fayre Lady whom the king loued and was lodged in the tower of the Parke: the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:11025:115"/>
king comming within ſight of the tower, and being diſpoſed to be merry, ſaid, <hi>Flamock</hi> let vs rime: as well as I can ſaid <hi>Flamock</hi> if it pleaſe your grace. The king began thus:
<q>
                     <l>Within this towre,</l>
                     <l>There lieth a flowre,</l>
                     <l>That hath my hart.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flamock</hi> for aunſwer: <hi>Within this hower, ſhe will, &amp;c.</hi> with the reſt in ſo vncleanly termes, as might not now become me by the rule of <hi>Decorum</hi> to vtter writing to ſo great a Maieſtie, but the king tooke them in ſo euill part, as he bid <hi>Flamock</hi> auant varlet, and that he ſhould no more be ſo neere vnto him. And wherein I would faine learne, lay this vndecencie? in the skurrill and filthy termes not meete for a kings care? perchance ſo. For the king was a wiſe and graue man, and though he hated not a faire wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet liked he nothing well to heare ſpeeches of ribaudrie: as they report of th'emperour <hi>Octauian: Licet fuerit ipſe incontinentiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, fuit tamen incontinente ſeueriſſimus vltor.</hi> But the very cauſe in deed was for that <hi>Flamocks</hi> reply anſwered not the kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for the kings rime commencing with a pleaſant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Sir <hi>Andrew Flamock</hi> to finiſh it not with loue but with lothſomneſſe, by termes very rude and vnciuill, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the king greatly fauour that Ladie for her much beauty by like or ſome other good partes, by his faſtidious aunſwer to make her ſeeme odious to him, it helde a great diſproportion to the kings appetite, for nothing is ſo vnpleaſant to a man, as to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred in his chiefe affection, &amp; ſpecially in his loues, &amp; whom we honour we ſhould alſo reuerence their appetites, or at the leaſt beare with them (not being wicked and vtterly euill) and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they do affect, we do not as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vs if we make it ſeeme to them horrible. This in mine opinion was the chiefe cauſe of the vndecencie and alſo of the kings offence. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the great phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher knowing this very well, what time he put <hi>Caliſtenes</hi> to king <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> the greats ſeruice gaue him this leſſon. Sirra quoth he, ye go now from a ſcholler to be a courtier, ſee ye ſpeake to the king your maiſter, either nothing at all, or elſe that which pleaſeth him, which rule if <hi>Calistenes</hi> had followed and forborne to croſſe the kings appetite in diuerſe ſpeeches, it had not coſt him ſo
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:11025:116"/>
deepely as afterward it did. A like matter of offence fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene th'Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, &amp; an Embaſſadour of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I could name but will not for the great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the world had of his wiſdome and ſufficiency in that behalfe, and all for miſuſing of a terme. The king in the matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwixt him and Ladie <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Caſtill</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours awnt, found himſelfe grieued that the Emperour ſhould take her part and worke vnder hand with the Pope to hinder the diuorce: and gaue his Embaſſadour commiſſion in good termes to open his griefes to the Emperour, and to expoſtulat with his Maieſtie, for that he ſeemed to forget the kings great kindneſſe and friendſhip before times vſed with th'Emperour, aſwell by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing for him ſundry great ſummes of monie which were not all yet repayd: as alſo by furniſhing him at his neede with ſtore of men and munition to his warres, and now to be thus vſed he thought it a very euill requitall. The Embaſſadour for too much animoſitie and more then needed in the caſe, or perchance by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the proprietie of the Spaniſh tongue, told the Emperour among other words, that he was <hi>Hombre el mas ingrato enel mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> the ingrateſt perſon in the world to vſe his maiſter ſo. The Emperour tooke him ſuddainly with the word, and ſaid: calleſt thou me <hi>ingrato?</hi> I tell thee learne better termes, or elſe I will teach them thee. Th'Embaſſadour excuſed it by his commiſſion, and ſaid: they were the king his maiſters words, and not his owne. Nay quoth th'Emperour, thy maiſter durſt not haue ſent me theſe words, were it not for that broad ditch betweene him &amp; me, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſea, which is hard to paſſe with an army of reuenge. The Embaſſadour was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded away &amp; no more hard by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, til by ſome other means afterward the grief was either pacified or forgotten, &amp; all this inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce grew by miſuſe of one word, which being otherwiſe ſpoken &amp; in ſome ſort qualified, had eaſily holpen all, &amp; yet th'Embaſſadour might ſufficiently haue ſatisfied his commiſſion &amp; much better aduaunced his purpoſe, as to haue ſaid for this word <hi>[ye are ingrate,]</hi> ye haue not vſed ſuch gratitude towards him as he hath deſerued: ſo ye may ſee how a word ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vndecently, not knowing the phraſe or proprietie of a language, maketh a whole matter many times miſcarrie. In which reſpect it
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:11025:116"/>
is to be wiſhed, that none Ambaſſadour ſpeake his principall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements but in his own language or in another as naturall to him as his owne, and ſo it is vſed in all places of the world ſauing in England. The Princes and their commiſſioners fearing leaſt otherwiſe they might vtter any thing to their diſaduantage, or els to their diſgrace: and I my ſelfe hauing ſeene the Courts of Fraunce, Spaine, Italie, and that of the Empire, with many inferior Courts, could neuer perceiue that the moſt noble perſonages, though they knew very well how to ſpeake many forraine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, would at any times that they had bene ſpoken vnto, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere but in their owne, the Frenchman in French, the Spaniard in Spaniſh, the Italian in Italian, and the very Dutch Prince in the Dutch language: whether it were more for pride, or for feare of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lapſe, I cannot tell. And <hi>Henrie</hi> Earle of Arundel being an old Courtier and a very princely man in all his actions, kept that rule alwaies. For on a time paſſing from England towards Italie by her maieſties licence, he was very honorably enterteined at the Court of Bruſſels, by the Lady Duches of Parma, Regent there: and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at a banquet with her, where alſo was the Prince of Orange, with all the greateſt Princes of the ſtate, the Earle, though he could reaſonably well ſpeake French, would not ſpeake one French word, but all Engliſh, whether he asked any queſtion, or anſwered it, but all was done by Truchemen. In ſo much as the Prince of Orange maruelling at it, looked a ſide on that part where I ſtoode a beholder of the feaſt, and ſayd, I maruell your Noblemen of England doe not deſire to be better languaged in the forraine languages. This word was by and by reported to the Earle. Quoth the Earle againe, tell my Lord the Prince, that I loue to ſpeake in that language, in which I can beſt vtter my mind and not miſtake.</p>
               <p>Another Ambaſſadour vſed the like ouerſight by ouerweening himſelfe that he could naturally ſpeake the French tongue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in troth he was not skilfull in their termes. This Ambaſſadour being a Bohemian, ſent from the Emperour to the French Court, where after his firſt audience, he was highly feaſted and banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. On a time, among other, a great Princeſſe ſitting at the table, by way of talke asked the Ambaſſador whether the Empreſſe his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:11025:117"/>
his miſtreſſe when ſhe went a hunting, or otherwiſe trauailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for her ſolace, did ride a horsback or goe in her coach. To which the Ambaſſadour anſwered vnwares and not knowing the French terme, <hi>Par ma foy elle cheuauche fort bien, &amp; ſi en prend grand plaiſir.</hi> She rides (ſaith he) very well, and takes great pleaſure in it. There was good ſmiling one vpon another of the Ladies and Lords, the Ambaſſador wiſt not whereat, but laughed himſelfe for companie. This word <hi>Cheuaucher</hi> in the French tongue hath a reprobate ſence, ſpecially being ſpoken of a womans riding.</p>
               <p>And as rude and vnciuill ſpeaches carry a marueilous great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencie, ſo doe ſometimes thoſe that be ouermuch affected and nice: or that doe ſauour of ignorance or adulation, and be in the eare of graue and wiſe perſons no leſſe offenſiue than the other: as when a ſutor in Rome came to <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor and ſaid, I would open my caſe to your Maieſtie, if it were not to trouble your ſacred buſineſſe, <hi>ſacras veſtras occupationes</hi> as the Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher reporteth. What meaneſt thou by that terme quoth the Emperor, ſay <hi>laborioſas</hi> I pray thee, &amp; ſo thou maiſt truely ſay, and bid him leaue off ſuch affected flattering termes.</p>
               <p>The like vndecencie vſed a Herald at armes ſent by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperor, to <hi>Fraunces</hi> the firſt French king, bringing him a meſſage of defiance, and thinking to qualifie the bitterneſſe of his meſſage with words pompous and magnificent for the kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, vſed much this terme (ſacred Maieſtie) which was not vſually geuen to the French king, but to ſay for the moſt part <hi>[Sire]</hi> The French king neither liking of his errant, nor yet of his pompous ſpeech, ſaid ſomewhat ſharply, I pray thee good fellow clawe me not where I itch not with thy ſacred maieſtie, but goe to thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and tell thine errand in ſuch termes as are decent betwixt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, for thy maſter is not my frend, and turned him to a Prince of the bloud who ſtoode by, ſaying, me thinks this fellow ſpeakes like Biſhop <hi>Nicholas,</hi> for on Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> night commonly the Scholars of the Countrey make them a Biſhop, who like a fooliſh boy, goeth about bleſſing and preaching with ſo childiſh termes, as maketh the people laugh at his fooliſh counterfaite ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>And yet in ſpeaking or writing of a Princes affaires &amp; fortunes there is a certaine <hi>Decorum,</hi> that we may not vſe the ſame termes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:11025:117"/>
in their buſines, as we might very wel doe in a meaner perſons, the caſe being all one, ſuch reuerence is due to their eſtates. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if an Hiſtoriographer ſhal write of an Emperor or King, how ſuch a day hee ioyned battel with his enemie, and being ouer-laide ranne out of the fielde, and tooke his heeles, or put ſpurre to his horſe and fled as faſt as hee could: the termes be not decent, but of a meane ſouldier or captaine, it were not vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſpoken. And as one, who tranſlating certaine bookes of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgils Aeneidos</hi> into Engliſh meetre, ſaid that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was fayne to trudge out of Troy: which terme became better to be ſpoken of a beggar, or of a rogue, or a lackey: for ſo wee vſe to ſay to ſuch maner of people, be trudging hence.</p>
               <p>Another Engliſhing this word of <hi>Virgill [fato profugus]</hi> called <hi>Aeneas [by fate a fugitiue]</hi> which was vndecently ſpoken, and not to the Authours intent in the ſame word: for whom he ſtudied by all means to auaunce aboue all other men of the world for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and magnanimitie, he meant not to make him a fugitiue. But by occaſion of his great diſtreſſes, and of the hardneſſe of his deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, he would haue it appeare that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was enforced to flie out of <hi>Troy,</hi> and for many yeeres to be a romer and a wandrer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world both by land and ſea <hi>[fato profugus]</hi> and neuer to find any reſting place till he came into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo as ye may euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly perceiue in this terme <hi>[fugitiue]</hi> a notable indignity offred to that princely perſon, and by th'other word (a wanderer) none indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at all, but rather a terme of much loue and commiſeration. The ſame tranſlatour when he came to theſe wordes: <hi>Inſignem pietate virum, tot voluere caſus tot adire labores compulit.</hi> Hee turned it thus, what moued <hi>Iuno</hi> to tugge ſo great a captaine as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> which word tugge ſpoken in this caſe is ſo vndecent as none other coulde haue bene deuiſed, and tooke his firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from the cart, becauſe it ſignifieth the pull or draught of the oxen or horſes, and therefore the leathers that beare the chiefe ſtreſſe of the draught, the cartars call them tugges, and ſo wee vſe to ſay that ſhrewd boyes tugge each other by the eares, for pull.</p>
               <p>Another of our vulgar makers, ſpake as illfaringly in this verſe written to the diſpraiſe of a rich man and couetous. Thou haſt a

miſers minde (thou haſt a princes pelfe] a lewde terme to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a princes treaſure, which in no reſpect nor for any cauſe is to be called pelfe, though it were neuer ſo meane, for pelfe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſcrappes or ſhreds of taylors and of skinners, which are accompted of ſo vile price as they be commonly caſt out of dores, or otherwiſe beſtowed vpon baſe purpoſes: and carrieth not the like reaſon or decencie, as when we ſay in reproch of a niggard or vſerer, or worldly couetous man, that he ſetteth more by a little pelfe of the world, than by his credit or health, or conſcience. For in compariſon of theſe treaſours all the gold or ſiluer in the world may by a skornefull terme be called pelfe, &amp; ſo ye ſee that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the decencie holdeth not alike in both caſes. Now let vs paſſe from theſe examples, to treate of thoſe that concerne the comelineſſe and decencie of mans behauiour.</p>
               <p>And ſome ſpeech may be whan it is ſpoken very vndecent, and yet the ſame hauing afterward ſomewhat added to it may become prety and decent, as was the ſtowte worde vſed by a captaine in Fraunce, who ſitting at the lower end of the Duke of <hi>Guyſes</hi> table among many, the day after there had bene a great battaile fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Duke finding that this captaine was not ſeene that day to do any thing in the field, taxed him priuily thus in al the hearings. Where were you Sir the day of the battaile, for I ſaw ye not? the captaine anſwered promptly: where ye durſt not haue bene: and the Duke began to kindle with the worde, which the Gentleman perceiuing, ſaid ſpedily: I was that day among the carriages, where your excellencie would not for a thouſand crownes haue bene ſeene. Thus from vndecent it came by a wittie reformation to be made decent againe.</p>
               <p>The like hapned on a time at the Duke of Northumberlandes bourd, where merry <hi>Iohn Heywood</hi> was allowed to ſit at the tables end. The Duke had a very noble and honorable mynde alwayes to pay his debts well, and when he lacked money, would not ſtick to ſell the greateſt part of his plate: ſo had he done few dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Heywood</hi> being loth to call for his drinke ſo oft as he was dry, turned his eye toward the cupbord and ſayd I finde great miſſe of your graces ſtanding cups: the Duke thinking he had ſpoken it of ſome knowledge that his plate was lately ſold, ſaid ſomewhat
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11025:118"/>
ſharpely, why Sir will not thoſe cuppes ſerue as good a man as your ſelfe. <hi>Heywood</hi> readily replied. Yes if it pleaſe your grace, but I would haue one of them ſtand ſtill at myne elbow full of drinke that I might not be driuen to trouble your men ſo often to call for it. This pleaſant and ſpeedy reuers of the former wordes holpe all the matter againe, whereupon the Duke became very pleaſaunt and dranke a bolle of wine to <hi>Heywood,</hi> and bid a cup ſhould alwayes be ſtanding by him.</p>
               <p>It were to buſie a peece of worke for me to tell you of all the partes of decencie and indecency which haue bene obſerued in the ſpeaches of man &amp; in his writings, and this that I tell you is rather to ſolace your eares with pretie conceits after a ſort of long ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall preceptes which may happen haue doubled them, rather then for any other purpoſe of inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or doctrine, which to any Courtier of experience, is not neceſſarie in this behalfe. And as they appeare by the former examples to reſt in our ſpeach and writing: ſo do the ſame by like proportion conſiſt in the whole behauiour of man, and that which he doth well and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is euer decent, and the contrary vndecent, not in euery mans iudgement alwayes one, but after their ſeuerall diſcretion and by circumſtance diuerſly, as by the next Chapter ſhalbe ſhewed.</p>

                  <p>Of decencie in behauiour which alſo belongs to the conſideration of the Poet or maker.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd there is a dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy to be obſerued in euery mans actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour aſwell as in his ſpeach &amp; writing which ſome perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture would thinke impertinent to be treated of in this booke, where we do but informe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable faſhions of language &amp; ſtile: but that is otherwiſe, for the good maker or poet who is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſpeach &amp; good termes to deſcribe all things and with prayſe or diſpraiſe to report euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s behauiour, ought to know the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwell as of a word &amp; thereby to direct himſelfe both in praiſe &amp; perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or any other point that perteines to the Oratours arte. Wherefore ſome exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples we will ſet downe of this maner of dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in behauiour leauing you for the reſt to our booke which we haue written <hi>de Decoro,</hi> where ye ſhall ſee both partes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:11025:119"/>
handled more exactly. And this decencie of mans behauiour aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as of his ſpeach muſt alſo be deemed by diſcretion, in which regard the thing that may well become one man to do may not become another, and that which is ſeemely to be done in this place is not ſo ſeemely in that, and at ſuch a time decent, but at another time vndecent, and in ſuch a caſe and for ſuch a purpoſe, and to this and that end and by this and that euent, peruſing all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration. Therefore we ſay that it might become king <hi>Alexander</hi> to giue a hundreth talentes to <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> the Philoſopher, but not for a beggerly Philoſopher to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo great a gift, for ſuch a Prince could not be impoueriſhed by that expence, but the Philoſopher was by it exceſſiuely to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, ſo was the kings action proportionable to his eſtate and therefore decent, the Philoſophers, diſproportionable both to his profeſſion and calling and therefore indecent.</p>
               <p>And yet if we ſhall examine the ſame point with a clearer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, it may be ſaid that whatſoeuer it might become king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> of his regal largeſſe to beſtow vpon a poore Philoſopher vnasked, that might aſwell become the Philoſopher to receiue at his hands without refuſal, and had otherwiſe bene ſome empea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chement of the kings abilitie or wiſedome, which had not bene decent in the Philoſoper, nor the immoderatneſſe of the kinges gift in reſpect of the Philoſophers meane eſtate made his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the leſſe decent, ſince Princes liberalities are not meaſured by merite nor by other mens eſtimations, but by their owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petits and according to their greatneſſe. So ſaid king <hi>Alexander</hi> very like himſelfe to one <hi>Perillus</hi> to whom he had geuen a very great gift, which he made curteſy to accept, ſaying it was too much for ſuch a mean perſon, what quoth the king if it be too much for thy ſelfe, haſt thou neuer a friend or kinſman that may fare the better by it? But peraduenture if any ſuch immoderat gift had bene craued by the Philoſopher and not voluntarily offred by the king it had bene vndecent to haue taken it. Euen ſo if one that ſtandeth vpon his merite, and ſpares to craue the Princes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie in that which is moderate and fit for him, doth as vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently. For men ſhould not expect till the Prince remembred it of himſelfe and began as it were the gratification, but ought to be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:11025:119"/>
put in remembraunce by humble ſolicitations, and that is dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; decent, which made king <hi>Henry</hi> th'eight her Maieſties moſt noble father, and for liberality nothing inferiour to king <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the great, aunſwere one of his priuie chamber, who prayd him to be good &amp; gracious to a certaine old Knight being his ſeruant, for that he was but an ill begger, if he be aſhamed to begge we wil thinke ſcorne to giue. And yet peraduenture in both theſe caſes, the vndecencie for too much crauing or ſparing to craue, might be eaſily holpen by a decent magnificence in the Prince, as <hi>Amazis</hi> king of Aegypt very honorably conſidered, who asking one day for one <hi>Diopithus</hi> a noble man of his Court, what was become of him for that he had not ſene him wait of long time, one about the king told him that he heard ſay he was ſicke and of ſome conceit he had taken that his Maieſtie had but ſlenderly looked to him, vſing many others very bountifully. I beſhrew his fooles head quoth the king, why had he not ſued vnto vs and made vs priuie of his want, then added, but in truth we are moſt to blame our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, who by a mindeful beneficence without ſute ſhould haue ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his baſhfulneſſe, and forthwith commaunded a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in money &amp; penſion to be ſent vnto him, but it hapned that when the kings meſſengers entred the chamber of <hi>Diopithus,</hi> he had newly giuen vp the ghoſt: the meſſengers ſorrowed the caſe, and <hi>Diopithus</hi> friends ſate by and wept, not ſo much for <hi>Diopithus</hi> death, as for pitie that he ouerliued not the comming of the kings reward. Therupon it came euer after to be vſed for a prouerbe that when any good turne commeth too late to be vſed, to cal it <hi>Diopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> reward.</p>
               <p>In Italy and Fraunce I haue knowen it vſed for common pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, the Princes to differre the beſtowing of their great liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as Cardinalſhips and other high dignities &amp; offices of gayne, till the parties whom they ſhould ſeeme to gratifie be ſo old or ſo ſicke as it is not likely they ſhould long enioy them.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth French king, I being at the Spaw waters, there lay a Marſhall of Fraunce called <hi>Monſieur de Sipier,</hi> to vſe thoſe waters for his health, but when the Phiſitions had all giuen him vp, and that there was no hope of life in him, came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king to him a letters patents of ſix thouſand crownes
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:11025:120"/>
yearely penſion during his life with many comfortable wordes: the man was not ſo much paſt remembraunce, but he could ſay to the meſſenger <hi>trop tard, trop tard,</hi> it ſhould haue come before, for in deede it had bene promiſed long and came not till now that he could not fare the better by it.</p>
               <p>And it became king <hi>Antiochus,</hi> better to beſtow the faire Lady <hi>Stratonica</hi> his wife vpon his ſonne <hi>Demetrius</hi> who lay ſicke for her loue and would elſe haue periſhed, as the Phyſitions cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouered by the beating of his pulſe, then it could become <hi>Demetrius</hi> to be inamored with his fathers wife, or to enioy her of his guift, becauſe the fathers act was led by diſcretion and of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly compaſſion, not grutching to depart from his deereſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to ſaue his childes life, where as the ſonne in his appetite had no reaſon to lead him to loue vnlawfully, for whom it had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bene decent to die, then to haue violated his fathers bed with ſafetie of his life.</p>
               <p>No more would it be ſeemely for an aged man to play the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton like a child, for it ſtands not with the conueniency of nature, yet when king <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> hauing a great ſort of little children, was one day diſpoſed to ſolace himſelf among them in a gallery where they plaied, and tooke a little hobby horſe of wood and beſtrid it to keepe them in play, one of his friends ſeemed to miſlike his lightnes, ô good friend quoth <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> rebuke me not for this fault till thou haue children of thine owne, ſhewing in deede that it came not of vanitie but of a fatherly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ioying in the ſport and company of his little children, in which reſpect and as that place and time ſerued, it was diſpenceable in him &amp; not indecent.</p>
               <p>And in the choiſe of a mans delights &amp; maner of his life, there is a decencie, and ſo we ſay th'old man generally is no fit compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the young man, nor the rich for the poore, nor the wiſe for the fooliſh. Yet in ſome reſpects and by diſcretion it may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as when the old man hath the gouernment of the young, the wiſe teaches the fooliſh, the rich is wayted on by the poore for their reliefe, in which regard the conuerſation is not indecent.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Proclus</hi> the Philoſopher knowing how euery indecencie is vnpleaſant to nature, and namely, how vncomely a thing it is for young men to doe as old men doe (at leaſtwiſe as young men
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:11025:120"/>
for the moſt part doe take it) applyed it very wittily to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for hauing his ſonne and heire a notable vnthrift, &amp; deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in nothing but in haukes and hounds, and gay apparrell, and ſuch like vanities, which neither by gentle nor ſharpe admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his father, could make him leaue: <hi>Proclus</hi> himſelfe not onely bare with his ſonne, but alſo vſed it himſelfe for company, which ſome of his frends greatly rebuked him for, ſaying, ô <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> an olde man and a Philoſopher to play the foole and laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous more than the ſonne. Mary, quoth <hi>Proclus,</hi> &amp; therefore I do it, for it is the next way to make my ſonne change his life, when he ſhall ſee how vndecent it is in me to leade ſuch a life, and for him being a yong man, to keepe companie with me being an old man, and to doe that which I doe.</p>
               <p>So is it not vnſeemely for any ordinarie Captaine to winne the victory or any other auantage in warre by fraud &amp; breach of faith: as <hi>Hanniball</hi> with the Romans, but it could not well become the Romaines managing ſo great an Empire, by examples of honour and iuſtice to doe as <hi>Hanniball</hi> did. And when <hi>Parmenio</hi> in a like caſe perſwaded king <hi>Alexander</hi> to breake the day of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſet vpon <hi>Darius</hi> at the ſodaine, which <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to doe, <hi>Parmenio</hi> ſaying, I would doe it if I were <hi>Alexander,</hi> and I too quoth <hi>Alexander</hi> if I were <hi>Parmenio:</hi> but it behooueth me in honour to fight liberally with mine enemies, and iuſtly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. And thus ye ſee that was decent in <hi>Parmenios</hi> action, which was not in the king his maſters.</p>
               <p>A great nobleman and Counſeller in this Realme was ſecretlie aduiſed by his friend, not to vſe ſo much writing his letters in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of euery man that asked them, ſpecially to the Iudges of the Realme in caſes of iuſtice. To whom the noble man anſwered, it becomes vs Councellors better to vſe inſtance for our friend, then for the Iudges to ſentence at inſtance: for whatſoeuer we doe require them, it is in their choiſe to refuſe to doe, but for all that the example was ill and dangerous.</p>
               <p>And there is a decencie in chuſing the times of a mans buſines, and as the Spaniard ſayes, <hi>es tiempo de negotiar,</hi> there is a fitte time for euery man to performe his buſineſſe in, &amp; to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his affaires, which out of that time would be vndecent: as to ſleepe al day and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:11025:121"/>
wake al night, and to goe a hunting by torch-light, as an old Earle of Arundel vſed to doe, or for any occaſion of little importance, to wake a man out of his ſleepe, or to make him riſe from his dinner to talke with him, or ſuch like importunities, for ſo we call euery vnſeaſonable action, and the vndecencie of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Callicratides</hi> being ſent Ambaſſador by the Lacedemonians, to <hi>Cirus</hi> the young king of Perſia to contract with him for money and men toward their warres againſt the Athenians, came to the Court at ſuch vnſeaſonable time as the king was yet in the midſt of his dinner, and went away againe ſaying, it is now no time to interrupt the kings mirth. He came againe another day in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noone, and finding the king at a rere-banquet, and to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the wine ſomewhat plentifully, turned back againe, ſaying, I thinke there is no houre fitte to deale with <hi>Cirus,</hi> for he is euer in his banquets: I will rather leaue all the buſines vndone, then doe any thing that ſhall not become the Lacedemonians: meaning to offer conference of ſo great importaunce to his Countrey, with a man ſo diſtempered by ſurfet, as hee was not likely to geue him any reaſonable reſolution in the cauſe.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Eudamidas</hi> brother to king <hi>Agis</hi> of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by <hi>Zenocrates</hi> ſchoole and looking in, ſaw him ſit in his chaire, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with a long hoare beard, asked who it was, one anſwered, Sir it is a wiſe man and one of them that ſearches after vertue, and if he haue not yet found it quoth <hi>Eudamidas</hi> when will he vſe it, that now at this yeares is ſeeking after it, as who would ſay it is not time to talke of matters when they ſhould be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor for an old man to be to ſeeke what vertue is, which all his youth he ſhould haue had in exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Another time comming to heare a notable Philoſopher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, it happened, that all was ended euen as he came, and one of his familiers would haue had him requeſted the Philoſopher to beginne againe, that were indecent and nothing ciuill quoth <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damidas,</hi> for if he ſhould come to me ſupperleſſe when I had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped before, were it ſeemely for him to pray me to ſuppe againe for his companie?</p>
               <p>And the place makes a thing decent or indecent, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration one <hi>Euboidas</hi> being ſent Embaſſadour into a forraine
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:11025:121"/>
realme, ſome of his familiars tooke occaſion at the table to praiſe the wiues and women of that country in preſence of their owne husbands, which th'embaſſadour miſliked, and when ſupper was ended and the gueſtes departed, tooke his familiars aſide, and told them that is was nothing decent in a ſtrange country to praiſe the women, nor ſpecially a wife before her husbands face, for inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie that might riſe thereby, aſwell to the prayſer as to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that the chiefe commendation of a chaſt matrone, was to be knowen onely to her husband, and not to be obſerued by ſtraungers and gueſtes.</p>
               <p>And in the vſe of apparell there is no litle decency and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie to be perceiued, as well for the faſhion as the ſtuffe, for it is comely that euery eſtate and vocation ſhould be knowen by the differences of their habit: a clarke from a lay man: a gentleman from a yeoman: a ſouldier from a citizen, and the chiefe of euery degree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their inferiours, becauſe in confuſion and diſorder there is no manner of decencie.</p>
               <p>The Romaines of any other people moſt ſeuere ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſurers of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, thought no vpper garment ſo comely for a ciuill man as a long playted gowne, becauſe it ſheweth much grauitie &amp; alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicitie, hiding euery member of the body which had not bin plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to behold. In ſomuch as a certain <hi>Proconſull</hi> or Legat of theirs dealing one day with <hi>Ptolome</hi> king of Egipt, ſeeing him clad in a ſtraite narrow garment very laſciuiouſly, diſcouering euery part of his body, gaue him a great checke for it: and ſaid, that vnleſſe he vſed more ſad and comely garments, the Romaines would take no pleaſure to hold amitie with him, for by the wantonnes of his garment they would iudge the vanitie of his mind, not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their conſtant friendſhip. A pleaſant old courtier wearing one day in the ſight of a great councellour, after the new guiſe a french cloake skarce reaching to the waſt, a long beaked doublet hanging downe to his thies, &amp; an high paire of ſilke netherſtocks that couered all his buttockes and loignes the Councellor marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſee him in that ſort diſguiſed, and otherwiſe than he had bin woont to be. Sir quoth the Gentleman to excuſe it: if I ſhould not be able whan I had need to piſſe out of my doublet, and to do the reſt in my netherſtocks (vſing the plaine terme) all men would
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:11025:122"/>
ſay I were but a lowte, the Councellor laughed hartily at the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie of the ſpeech, but what would thoſe ſower fellowes of Rome haue ſaid trowe ye? truely in mine opinion, that all ſuch perſons as take pleaſure to ſhew their limbes, ſpecially thoſe that nature hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded out of ſight, ſhould be inioyned either to go ſtarke naked, or elſe to reſort backe to the comely and modeſt faſhion of their owne countrie apparell, vſed by their old honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aunceſtors.</p>
               <p>And there is a dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of apparrel in reſpect of the place where it is to be vſed: as, in the Court to be richely apparrelled: in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to weare more plain &amp; homely garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For who who would not thinke it a ridiculous thing to ſee a Lady in her milke-houſe with a veluet gowne, and at a bridall in her caſſock of mockado: a Gentleman of the Countrey among the buſhes and briers, goe in a pounced dublet and a paire of embrodered hoſen, in the Citie to weare a friſe Ierkin and a paire of leather breeches? yet ſome ſuch phantaſticals haue I knowen, and one a certaine knight, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt vaine, who commonly would come to the Seſſions, and other ordinarie meetings and Commiſſions in the Countrey, ſo bedect with buttons and aglets of gold and ſuch coſtly embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, as the poore plaine men of the Countrey called him (for his gayneſſe) the golden knight. Another for the like cauſe was called Saint Sunday: I thinke at this day they be ſo farre ſpent, as either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be content with a good cloath cloake: and this came by want of diſcretion, to diſcerne and deeme right of decencie, which many Gentlemen doe wholly limite by the perſon or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, where reaſon doeth it by the place and preſence: which may be ſuch as it might very well become a great Prince to weare cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer apparrell than in another place or preſence a meaner perſon.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe in the vſe of a garment many occaſions alter the decencie, ſometimes the qualitie of the perſon, ſometimes of the caſe, otherwhiles the countrie cuſtome, and often the conſtitution of lawes, and the very nature of vſe it ſelfe. As for example a king and prince may vſe rich and gorgious apparell decently, ſo cannot a meane perſon doo, yet if an herald of armes to whom a king gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his gowne of cloth of gold, or to whom it was incident as a fee of his office, do were the ſame, he doth it decently, becauſe ſuch
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:11025:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath alwaies bene th'allowances of heraldes: but if ſuch herald haue worne out, or ſold, or loſt that gowne, to buy him a new of the like ſtuffe with his owne mony and to weare it, is not decent in the eye and iudgement of them that know it.</p>
               <p>And the country cuſtome maketh things decent in vſe, as in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia for all men to weare long gownes both a foot and horſebacke: in Europa ſhort gaberdins, or clokes, or iackets, euen for their vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per garments. The Turke and Perſian to weare great tolibants of ten, fifteene, and twentie elles of linnen a peece vpon their heads, which can not be remooued: in Europe to were caps or hats, which vpon euery occaſion of ſalutation we vſe to put of, as a ſigne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence. In th'Eaſt partes the men to make water couring like wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with vs ſtanding at a wall. With them to congratulat and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute by giuing a becke with the head, or a bende of the bodie, with vs here in England, and in Germany, and all other Northerne parts of the world to ſhake handes. In France, Italie, and Spaine to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ouer the ſhoulder, vnder the armes, at the very knees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſuperiors degree. With vs the wemen giue their mouth to be kiſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in other places their cheek, in many places their hand, or in ſteed of an offer to the hand, to ſay theſe words <hi>Bezo los ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</hi> And yet ſome others ſurmounting in all courtly ciuilitie will ſay, <hi>Los manos &amp; los piedes.</hi> And aboue that reach too, there be that will ſay to the Ladies, <hi>Lombra de ſus piſadas,</hi> the ſhadow of your ſteps. Which I recite vnto you to ſhew the phraſe of thoſe courtly ſeruitours in yeelding the miſtreſſes honour and reuerence.</p>
               <p>And it is ſeen that very particular vſe of it ſelfe makes a matter of much decencie and vndecencie, without any countrey cuſtome or allowance, as if one that hath many yeares worne a gowne ſhall come to be ſeen weare a iakquet or ierkin, or he that hath many yeares worne a beard or long haire among thoſe that had done the contrary, and come ſodainly to be pold or ſhauen, it will ſeeme onely to himſelfe, a deshight and very vndecent, but alſo to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that neuer vſed to go ſo, vntill the time and cuſtome haue abrogated that miſlike.</p>
               <p>So was it here in England till her Maieſties moſt noble father for diuers good reſpects, cauſed his owne head and all his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to be polled and his beard to be cut ſhort. Before that time it
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:11025:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was thought more decent both for old men and young to be all ſhauen and to weare long haire either rounded or ſquare. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at this time, the young Gentlemen of the Court haue taken vp the long haire trayling on their ſhoulders, and thinke it more decent: for what reſpect I would be glad to know.</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians bearing long buſhes of haire, finely kept &amp; curled vp, vſed this ciuill argument to maintaine that cuſtome. Haire (ſay they) is the very ornament of nature appointed for the head, which therfore to vſe in his moſt ſumptuous degree is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpecially for them that be Lordes, Maiſters of men, and of a free life, hauing abilitie &amp; leaſure inough to keepe it cleane, and ſo for a ſigne of ſeignorie, riches and libertie, the maſters of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians vſed long haire. But their vaſſals, ſeruaunts and ſlaues vſed it ſhort or ſhauen in ſigne of ſeruitude and becauſe they had no meane nor leaſure to kembe and keepe it cleanely. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides comberſome to them hauing many buſineſſe to attende, in ſome ſeruices there might no maner of filth be falling from their heads. And to all ſouldiers it is very noyſome and a daungerous diſauantage in the warres or in any particular combat, which being the moſt comely profeſſion of euery noble young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it ought to perſwade them greatly from wearing long haire. If there be any that ſeeke by long haire to helpe or to hide an ill featured face, it is in them allowable ſo to do, becauſe euery man may decently reforme by arte, the faultes and imperfections that nature hath wrought in them.</p>
               <p>And all ſingularities or affected parts of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s behauiour ſeeme vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as for one man to march or iet in the ſtreet more ſtately, or to looke more ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnely, or to go more gayly &amp; in other coulours or faſhioned garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then another of the ſame degree and eſtate.</p>
               <p>Yet ſuch ſingularities haue had many times both good liking and good ſucceſſe, otherwiſe then many would haue looked for. As when <hi>Dinocrates</hi> the famous architect, deſirous to be knowen to king <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and hauing none acquaintance to bring him to the kings ſpeech, he came one day to the Court very ſtrangely apparelled in long skarlet robes, his head compaſt with a garland of Laurell, and his face all to be ſlicked with ſweet oyle, and ſtoode in the kings chamber, motioning nothing to any man:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:11025:123"/>
newes of this ſtranger came to the king, who cauſed him to be brought to his preſence, and asked his name, and the cauſe of his repaire to the Court. He aunſwered, his name was <hi>Dinocrates</hi> the Architect, who came to preſent his Maieſtie with a platforme of his owne deuiſing, how his Maieſtie might buylde a Citie vpon the mountaine Athos in Macedonia, which ſhould beare the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a mans body, and tolde him all how. Forſooth the breaſt and bulke of his body ſhould reſt vpon ſuch a flat: that hil ſhould be his head, all ſet with foregrowen woods like haire: his right arme ſhould ſtretch out to ſuch a hollow bottome as might be like his hand: holding a diſh conteyning al the waters that ſhould ſerue that Citie: the left arme with his hand ſhould hold a valley of all the orchards and gardens of pleaſure pertaining thereunto: and either legge ſhould lie vpon a ridge of rocke, very gallantly to behold, and ſo ſhould accompliſh the full figure of a man. The king asked him what commoditie of ſoyle, or ſea, or nauigable riuer lay neere vnto it, to be able to ſuſtaine ſo great a number of inhabitants. Truely Sir (quoth <hi>Dinocrates</hi>) I haue not yet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof: for in trueth it is the bareſt part of all the Countrey of Macedonia. The king ſmiled at it, and ſaid very honourably, we like your deuice well, and meane to vſe your ſeruice in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Citie, but we wil chuſe out a more commodious ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and made him attend in that voyage in which he conquered Aſia and Egypt, and there made him chiefe Surueyour of his new Citie of Alexandria. Thus did <hi>Dinocrates</hi> ſingularitie in attire greatly further him to his aduancement.</p>
               <p>Yet are generally all rare things and ſuch as breede maruell &amp; admiration ſomewhat holding of the vndecent, as when a man is bigger &amp; exceeding the ordinary ſtature of a man like a Giaunt, or farre vnder the reaſonable and common ſize of men, as a dwarfe, and ſuch vndecencies do not angre vs, but either we pittie them or ſcorne at them.</p>
               <p>But at all inſolent and vnwoonted partes of a mans behauiour, we find many times cauſe to miſlike or to be miſtruſtfull, which proceedeth of ſome vndecency that is in it, as when a man that hath alwaies bene ſtrange &amp; vnacquainted with vs, will ſuddenly become our familiar and domeſtick: and another that hath bene
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:11025:124"/>
alwaies ſterne and churliſh, wilbe vpon the ſuddaine affable and curteous, it is neyther a comely ſight, nor a ſigne of any good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs. Which the ſubtill Italian well obſerued by the ſucceſſes thereof, ſaying in Prouerbe. <q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Chi me ſa meglio che non ſuole,</l>
                        <l>Tradito me ha o tradir me vuole</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>He that ſpeakes me fairer, than his woont was too</l>
                        <l>Hath done me harme, or meanes for to doo.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now againe all maner of conceites that ſtirre vp any vehement paſſion in a man, doo it by ſome turpitude or euill and vndecency that is in them, as to make a man angry there muſt be ſome iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or contempt offered, to make him enuy there muſt proceede ſome vndeſerued proſperitie of his egall or inferiour, to make him pitie ſome miſerable fortune or ſpectakle to behold.</p>
               <p>And yet in euery of theſe paſſions being as it were vndecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, there is a comelineſſe to be diſcerned, which ſome men can keepe and ſome men can not, as to be angry, or to enuy, or to hate, or to pitie, or to be aſhamed decently, that is none otherwiſe then reaſon requireth. This ſurmiſe appeareth to be true, for <hi>Homer</hi> the father of Poets writing that famous and moſt honourable poeme called the <hi>Illiades</hi> or warres of Troy: made his comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cement the magnanimous wrath and anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> in his firſt verſe thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Sing foorth my muſe the wrath of <hi>Achilles Peleus</hi> ſonne: which the Poet would neuer haue done if the wrath of a prince had not beene in ſome ſort comely &amp; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But when <hi>Arrianus</hi> and <hi>Curtius</hi> hiſtoriographers that wrote the noble geſtes of king <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, came to prayſe him for many things, yet for his wrath and anger they reproched him, becauſe it proceeded not of any magnanimitie, but vpon ſurfet &amp; diſtemper in his diet, nor growing of any iuſt cauſes, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to the deſtruction of his deareſt friends and familiers, and not of his enemies nor any other waies ſo honorably as th'others was, and ſo could not be reputed a decent and comely anger.</p>
               <p>So may al your other paſſions be vſed decently though the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter of their originall be grounded vpon ſome vndecencie, as it is written by a certaine king of Egypt, who looking out of his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11025:124"/>
window, and ſeing his owne ſonne for ſome grieuous offence, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the officers of his iuſtice to the place of execution: he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once changed his countenance at the matter, though the ſight were neuer ſo full of ruth and atrocitie. And it was thought a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent countenance and conſtant animoſitie in the king to be ſo affected, the caſe concerning ſo high and rare a peece of his owne iuſtice. But within few daies after when he beheld out of the ſame window an old friend and familiar of his, ſtand begging an almes in the ſtreete, he wept tenderly, remembring their old familiarity and conſidering how by the mutabilitie of fortune and frailtie of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eſtate, it might one day come to paſſe that he himſelfe ſhould fall into the like miſerable eſtate. He therfore had a remorſe very comely for a king in that behalfe, which alſo cauſed him to giue order for his poore friends plentiful reliefe.</p>
               <p>But generally to weepe for any ſorrow (as one may doe for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) is not ſo decent in a man: and therefore all high minded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when they cannot chuſe but ſhed teares, wil turne away their face as a countenance vndecent for a man to ſhew, and ſo will the ſtanders by till they haue ſuppreſt ſuch paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinking it nothing decent to behold ſuch an vncomely countenance. But for Ladies and women to weepe and ſhed teares at euery little greefe, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vncomely, but rather a ſigne of much good nature &amp; meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde, a moſt decent propertie for that ſexe; and therefore they be for the more part more deuout and charitable, and greater geuers of almes than men, and zealous relieuers of priſoners, and beſeechers of pardons, and ſuch like parts of commiſeration. Yea they be more than ſo too: for by the common prouerbe, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will weepe for pitie to ſee a goſling goe barefoote.</p>
               <p>But moſt certainly all things that moue a man to laughter, as doe theſe ſcurrilities &amp; other ridiculous behauiours, it is for ſome vndecencie that is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in them: which maketh it decent for euery man to laugh at them. And therefore when we ſee or heare a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural foole and idiot doe or ſay any thing fooliſhly, we laugh not at him: but when he doeth or ſpeaketh wiſely, becauſe that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like him ſelfe: and a buffonne or counterfet foole, to heare him ſpeake wiſely which is like himſelfe, it is no ſport at all, but for ſuch a counterfait to talke and looke fooliſhly it maketh vs laugh,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:11025:125"/>
becauſe it is no part of his naturall, for in euery vncomlineſſe there muſt be a certaine abſurditie and diſproportion to nature, and the opinion of the hearer or beholder to make the thing ridiculous. But for a foole to talke fooliſhly or a wiſeman wiſely, there is no ſuch abſurditie or diſproportion.</p>
               <p>And though at all abſurdities we may decently laugh, &amp; when they be no abſurdities not decently, yet in laughing is there an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencie for other reſpectes ſometime, than of the matter it ſelfe, Which made <hi>Philippus</hi> ſonne to the firſt Chriſten Emperour, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Arabicus</hi> ſitting with his father one day in the theatre to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſports, giue his father a great rebuke becauſe he laughed, ſaying that it was no comely countenance for an Emperour to bewray in ſuch a publicke place, nor ſpecially to laugh at euery fooliſh toy: the poſteritie gaue the ſonne for that cauſe the name of <hi>Philippus Agelaſtos</hi> or without laughter.</p>
               <p>I haue ſeene forraine Embaſſadours in the Queenes preſence laugh ſo diſſolutely at ſome rare paſtime or ſport that hath beene made there, that nothing in the world could worſe haue becomen them, and others very wiſe men, whether it haue ben of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant humour and complexion, or for other default in the ſpleene, or for ill education or cuſtome, that could not vtter any graue and earneſt ſpeech without laughter, which part was greatly diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in them.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cicero</hi> the wiſeſt of any Romane writers, thought it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely for a man to daunce: ſaying, <hi>Saltantem ſobrium vidi nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> I neuer ſaw any man daunce that was ſober and in his right wits, but there by your leaue he failed, nor our young Courtiers will allow it, beſides that it is the moſt decent and comely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of all exultations and reioycements of the hart, which is no leſſe naturall to man then to be wiſe or well learned, or ſober.</p>
               <p>To tell you the decencies of a number of other behauiours, one might do it to pleaſe you with pretie reportes, but to the skilfull Courtiers it ſhalbe nothing neceſſary, for they know all by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience without learning. Yet ſome few remembraunces wee will make you of the moſt materiall, which our ſelues haue obſerued, and ſo make an end.</p>
               <p>It is decent to be affable and curteous at meales &amp; meetings, in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:11025:125"/>
open aſſemblies more ſolemne and ſtraunge, in place of authoritie and iudgement not familiar nor pleaſant, in counſell ſecret and ſad, in ordinary conferences eaſie and apert, in conuerſation ſimple, in capitulation ſubtill and miſtruſtfull, at mournings and burials ſad and ſorrowfull, in feaſts and bankets merry &amp; ioyfull, in houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold expence pinching and ſparing, in publicke entertainement ſpending and pompous. The Prince to be ſumptuous and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, the priuate man liberall with moderation, a man to be in giuing free, in asking ſpare, in promiſe ſlow, in performance ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in contract circumſpect but iuſt, in amitie ſincere, in ennimitie wily and cautelous [<hi>dolus an virtus quis in hoſte requirit,</hi> ſaith the Poet] and after the ſame rate euery ſort and maner of buſineſſe or affaire or action hath his decencie and vndecencie, either for the time or place or perſon or ſome other circumſtaunce, as Prieſts to be ſober and ſad, a Preacher by his life to giue good example, a Iudge to be incorrupted, ſolitarie and vnacquainted with Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Courtly entertainements, &amp; as the Philoſopher ſaith <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet iudice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſſe rudem &amp; ſimplicem,</hi> without plaite or wrinkle, ſower in looke and churliſh in ſpeach, contrariwiſe a Courtly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be loftie and curious in countenaunce, yet ſometimes a creeper, and a curry fauell with his ſuperiours.</p>
               <p>And touching the perſon, we ſay it is comely for a man to be a lambe in the houſe, and a Lyon in the field, appointing the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his qualitie by the place, by which reaſon alſo we limit the comely parts of a woman to conſiſt in foure points, that is to be a ſhrewe in the kitchin, a ſaint in the Church, an Angell at the bourd, and an Ape in the bed, as the Chronicle reportes by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe <hi>Shore</hi> paramour to king <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth.</p>
               <p>Then alſo there is a decency in reſpect of the perſons with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do negotiate, as with the great perſonages his egals to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and ſurly, with meaner men pleaſant and popular, ſtoute with the ſturdie and milde with the meek, which is a moſt decent conuerſation and not reprochfull or vnſeemely, as the prouerbe goeth, by thoſe that vſe the contrary, a Lyon among ſheepe and a ſheepe among Lyons.</p>
               <p>Right ſo in negotiating with Princes we ought to ſeeke their fauour by humilitie &amp; not by ſternneſſe, nor to trafficke with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:11025:126"/>
by way of indent or condition, but frankly and by manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their wils, for Princes may be lead but not driuen, nor they are to be vanquiſht by allegation, but muſt be ſuffred to haue the victorie and be relented vnto: nor they are not to be chalenged for right or iuſtice, for that is a maner of accuſation: nor to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with their promiſes, for that is a kinde of condemnation: and at their requeſt we ought not to be hardly entreated but eaſily, for that is a ſigne of deffidence and miſtruſt in their bountie and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: nor to recite the good ſeruices which they haue receiued at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for that is but a kind of exprobratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in crauing their bountie or largeſſe to remember vnto them all their former bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficences, making no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of our owne merites, &amp; ſo it is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and in prayſing them to their faces to do it very modeſtly: and in their commendations not to be exceſſiue for that is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and alwayes ſauours of ſuttelty more then of ſincere loue.</p>
               <p>And in ſpeaking to a Prince the voyce ought to be lowe and not lowde nor ſhrill, for th'one is a ſigne of humilitie th'other of too much audacitie and preſumption. Nor in looking on them ſeeme to ouerlooke them, nor yet behold them too ſtedfaſtly, for that is a ſigne of impudence or litle reuerence, and therefore to the great Princes Orientall their ſeruitours ſpeaking or being ſpoken vnto abbaſe their eyes in token of lowlines, which behauiour we do not obſerue to our Princes with ſo good a diſcretion as they do: &amp; ſuch as retire from the Princes preſence, do not by &amp; by turne tayle to them as we do, but go backward or ſideling for a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpace, til they be at the wal or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber doore paſſing out of ſight, and is thought a moſt decent behauiour to their ſoueraignes. I haue heard that king <hi>Henry</hi> th'eight her Maieſties father, though otherwiſe the moſt gentle and affable Prince of the world, could not abide to haue any man ſtare in his face or to fix his eye too ſteedily vpon him when he talked with them: nor for a common ſuter to exclame or cry out for iuſtice, for that is offenſiue and as it were a ſecret impeachement of his wrong doing, as happened once to a Knight in this Realme of great worſhip ſpeaking to the king. Nor in ſpeaches with them to be too long, or too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, for th'one is tedious th'other is irkſome, nor with lowd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to applaude them, for that is too popular &amp; rude and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:11025:126"/>
betokens either ignoraunce, or ſeldome acceſſe to their preſence, or little frequenting their Courts: nor to ſhew too mery or light a countenance, for that is a ſigne of little reuerence and is a peece of a contempt.</p>
               <p>And in gaming with a Prince it is decent to let him ſometimes win of purpoſe, to keepe him pleaſant, &amp; neuer to refuſe his gift, for that is vndutifull: nor to forgiue him his loſſes, for that is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant: nor to giue him great gifts, for that is either inſolence or follie: nor to feaſt him with exceſſiue charge for that is both vaine and enuious, &amp; therefore the wiſe Prince king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth her Maieſties grandfather, if his chaunce had bene to lye at any of his ſubiects houſes, or to paſſe moe meales then one, he that would take vpon him to defray the charge of his dyet, or of his officers and houſhold, he would be maruelouſly offended with it, ſaying what priuate ſubiect dare vndertake a Princes charge, or looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecret of his expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? Her Maieſtie hath bene knowne often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to miſlike the ſuperfluous expence of her ſubiects beſtowed vpon her in times of her progreſſes.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in matter of aduiſe it is neither decent to flatter him for that is ſeruile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither to be to rough or plaine with him, for that is daungerous, but truly to Counſell &amp; to admoniſh, grauely not greuouſly, ſincerely not ſourely: which was the part that ſo greatly commended <hi>Cineas</hi> Counſellour to king <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> who kept that decencie in all his perſwaſions, that he euer preuailed in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and carried the king which way he would.</p>
               <p>And in a Prince it is comely to giue vnasked, but in a ſubiect to aske vnbidden: for that firſt is ſigne of a bountifull mynde, this of a loyall &amp; confident. But the ſubiect that craues not at his Princes hand, either he is of no deſert, or proud, or miſtruſtfull of his Princes goodneſſe: therefore king <hi>Henry</hi> th'eight to one that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to remember one Sir <hi>Anthony Rouſe</hi> with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for that he had ſpent much and was an ill beggar: the king aunſwered (noting his inſolencie,) If he be aſhamed to begge, we are aſhamed to giue, and was neuertheleſſe one of the moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes of the world.</p>
               <p>And yet in ſome Courts it is otherwiſe vſed, for in Spaine it is thought very vndecent for a Courtier to craue, ſuppoſing that it is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:11025:127"/>
the part of an importune: therefore the king of ordinarie calleth euery ſecond, third or fourth yere for his Checker roll, and beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth his <hi>mercedes</hi> of his owne meere motion, and by diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to euery mans merite and condition.</p>
               <p>And in their commendable delights to be apt and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, as if the Prince be geuen to hauking, hunting, riding of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or playing vpon inſtruments, or any like exerciſe, the ſeruitour to be the ſame: and in their other appetites wherein the Prince would ſeeme an example of vertue, and would not miſlike to be egalled by others: in ſuch caſes it is decent their ſeruitours &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſtudie to be like to them by imitation, as in wearing their haire long or ſhort, or in this or that ſort of apparrell, ſuch excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as be only fitte for Princes and none els, which were vndecent for a meaner perſon to imitate or counterfet: ſo is it not comely to counterfet their voice, or looke, or any other geſtures that be not ordinary and naturall in euery common perſon: and therefore to go vpright or ſpeake or looke aſſuredly, it is decent in euery man. But if the Prince haue an extraordinarie countenance or manner of ſpeech, or bearing of his body, that for a common ſeruitour to counterfet is not decent, and therefore it was miſliked in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Nero,</hi> and thought vncomely for him to counterfet <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great by holding his head a little awrie, &amp; neerer toward the tone ſhoulder, becauſe it was not his owne naturall.</p>
               <p>And in a Prince it is decent to goe ſlowly, and to march with leyſure, and with a certaine granditie rather than grauitie: as our ſoueraine Lady and miſtreſſe, the very image of maieſtie and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, is accuſtomed to doe generally, vnleſſe it be when ſhe walketh apace for her pleaſure, or to catch her a heate in the colde mornings.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, it is not ſo decent in a meaner perſon, as I haue obſerued in ſome counterfet Ladies of the Countrey, which vſe it much to their owne deriſion. This comelines was wanting in Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> otherwiſe a very good and honourable Princeſſe. And was ſome blemiſh to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> a moſt noble minded man, yet ſo careleſſe and forgetfull of himſelfe in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, as I haue ſeene him runne vp a paire of ſtaires ſo ſwift and nimble a pace, as almoſt had not become a very meane man, who
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:11025:127"/>
had not gone in ſome haſtie buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>And in a noble Prince nothing is more decent and welbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his greatneſſe, than to ſpare foule ſpeeches, for that breedes hatred, and to let none humble ſuiters depart out of their preſence (as neere as may be) miſcontented. Wherein her Maieſtie hath of all others a moſt Regall gift, and nothing inferior to the good Prince <hi>Titus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſianus</hi> in that point.</p>
               <p>Alſo not to be paſſionate for ſmall detriments or offences, nor to be a reuenger of them, but in caſes of great iniurie, and ſpecially of diſhonors: and therein to be very ſterne and vindicatiue, for that ſauours of Princely magnanimitie: nor to ſeeke reuenge vpon baſe and obſcure perſons, ouer whom the conqueſt is not glorious, nor the victorie honourable, which reſpect moued our ſoueraign Lady (keeping alwaies the decorum of a Princely perſon) at her firſt comming to the crowne, when a knight of this Realme, who had very inſolently behaued himſelfe toward her when ſhe was Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> fell vpon his knee to her, and beſought her pardon: ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting (as there was good cauſe) that he ſhould haue bene ſent to the Tower, ſhe ſaid vnto him moſt mildly: do you not know that we are deſcended of the Lion, whoſe nature is not to harme or pray vpon the mouſe, or any other ſuch ſmall vermin?</p>
               <p>And with theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples I thinke ſufficient to leaue, geuing you information of this one point, that all your figures Poeticall or Rhethoricall, are but obſeruations of ſtrange ſpeeches, and ſuch as without any arte at al we ſhould vſe, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly do, euen by very nature without diſcipline.

               <argument>
                  <p>That the good Poet or maker ought to diſſemble his arte, and in what caſes the artificiall is more commended then the naturall, and contrariwiſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd now (moſt excellent Queene) hauing largely ſaid of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets &amp; Poeſie, and about what matters they be employed: then of all the commended fourmes of Poemes, thirdly of metricall proportions, ſuch as do appertaine to our vulgar arte: and laſt of all ſet forth the poeticall ornament co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting chiefly in the beautie and gallantneſſe of his language and ſtile, and ſo haue apparelled him to our ſeeming, in all his gorgious habilliments, and pulling him firſt from the carte to the ſchoole, and from thence to the Court, and preferred him to your Maieſties ſeruice, in that place of great honour and magnificence to geue enterteinment to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Ladies of honour, Gentlewomen and Gentlemen, and by his many moodes of skill, to ſerue the many humors of men thither haunting and reſorting, ſome by way of ſolace ſome of ſerious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and in matters aſwell profitable as pleaſant and honeſt: Wee haue in our humble conceit ſufficiently perfourmed our promiſe or rather dutie to your Maieſtie in the deſcription of this arte, ſo alwaies as we leaue him not vnfurniſht of one peece that beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes that place of any other, and may ſerue as a principall good leſſon for al good makers to beare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in mind, in the vſage of this ſcience: which is, that being now lately become a Courtier he ſhew not himſelf a craftsman, &amp; merit to be diſgraded, &amp; with ſcorne ſent back againe to the ſhop, or other place of his firſt facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and calling, but that ſo wiſely &amp; diſcreetly he behaue himſelfe as he may worthily retaine the credit of his place, and profeſſion of a very Courtier, which is in plaine termes, cunningly to be able to diſſemble. But (if it pleaſe your Maieſtie) may it not ſeeme inough for a Courtier to know how to weare a fether, and ſet his cappe a flaunt, his chaine <hi>en echarpe,</hi> a ſtraight buskin <hi>al ingleſſe,</hi> a looſe <hi>alo Turqueſque,</hi> the cape <hi>alla Spaniola,</hi> the breech a <hi>la Franaeoiſe,</hi> and by twentie maner of new faſhioned garments to diſguiſe his body, and his face with as many countenances, whereof it ſeemes there be many that make a very arte, and ſtudie who can ſhew himſelfe moſt fine, I will not ſay moſt fooliſh and ridiculous? or perhaps
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:11025:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather that he could diſſemble his conceits as well as his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſo as he neuer ſpeake as he thinkes, or thinke as he ſpeaks, and that in any matter of importance his words and his meaning very ſeldome meete: for ſo as I remember it was concluded by vs ſetting foorth the figure <hi>Allegoria,</hi> which therefore not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently we call the Courtier or figure of faire ſemblant, or is it not perchance more requiſite our courtly Poet do diſſemble not onely his countenances &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits, but alſo all his ordinary actions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, or the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby the better to winne his purpoſes &amp; good aduantages, as now &amp; then to haue a iourney or ſickneſſe in his ſleeue, thereby to ſhake of other importunities of greater conſequence, as they vſe their pilgrimages in Fraunce, the Diet in Spaine, the baines in Italy? and when a man is whole to faine himſelfe ſicke to ſhunne the buſineſſe in Court, to entertaine time and eaſe at home, to ſalue offences without diſcredite, to win purpoſes by mediation in abſence, which their preſence would ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impeach or not greatly preferre, to harken after the popular opinions and ſpeech, to entend to their more priuate ſolaces, to practize more deepely both at leaſure &amp; libertie, &amp; when any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique affaire or other atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt &amp; counſaile of theirs hath not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued good ſucceſſe, to auoid therby the Princes preſent reproofe, to coole their chollers by abſence, to winne remorſe by lamentable reports, and reconciliation by friends intreatie. Finally by ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring themſelues for a time fro the Court, to be able the freelier &amp; cleerer to diſcerne the factions and ſtate of the Court and of al the world beſides, no leſſe then doth the looker on or beholder of a game better ſee into all points of auauntage, then the player him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? and in diſſembling of diſeaſes which I pray you? for I haue obſerued it in the Court of Fraunce, not a burning feuer or a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, or a palſie, or the hydropick and ſwelling gowte, or any other like diſeaſe, for if they may be ſuch as may be either eaſily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or quickly cured, they be ill to diſſemble and doo halfe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly ſerue the turne.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be either a dry dropſie, or a megrim or letarge, or a fiſtule <hi>in ano,</hi> or ſome ſuch other ſecret diſeaſe, as the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant can hardly diſcouer, and the Phiſition either not ſpeedily heale, or not honeſtly bewray? of which infirmities the ſcoffing

                  <hi>Paſquil</hi> wrote, <hi>Vlcus veſicae renum dolor in pene ſcirrus.</hi> Or as I haue ſeene in diuers places where many make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues hart whole, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in deede they are full ſicke, bearing it ſtoutly out to the hazard of their health, rather then they would be ſuſpected of any lothſome infirmity, which might inhibit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Princes preſence, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ladies. Or as ſome other do to beare a port of ſtate &amp; plentie when they haue neither penny nor poſſeſſion, that they may not ſeeme to droope, and be reiected as vnworthy or inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the greater ſeruices, or be pitied for their pouertie, which they hold for a marueilous diſgrace, as did the poore Squire of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, who had rather dine with a ſheepes head at home &amp; drinke a cruſe of water to it, then to haue a good dinner giuen him by his friend who was nothing ignorant of his pouertie. Or as others do to make wiſe they be poore when they be riche, to ſhunne thereby the publicke charges and vocations, for men are not now a dayes (ſpecially in ſtates of <hi>Oligarchie</hi> as the moſt in our age) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo much for their wiſedome as for their wealth, alſo to auoyde enuie of neighbours or bountie in conuerſation, for whoſoeuer is reputed rich cannot without reproch, but be either a lender or a ſpender. Or as others do to ſeeme very buſie when they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doo, and yet will make themſelues ſo occupied and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laden in the Princes affaires, as it is a great matter to haue a couple of wordes with them, when notwithſtanding they lye ſleeping on their beds all an after noone, or ſit ſolemnly at cardes in their chambers, or enterteyning of the Dames, or laughing and gibing with their familiars foure houres by the clocke, whiles the poore ſuter deſirous of his diſpatch is aunſwered by ſome Secretarie or page <hi>il fault attendre, Monſieur</hi> is diſpatching the kings buſineſſe into Languedock, Prouence Piemont, a common phraſe with the Secretaries of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Or as I haue obſerued in many of the Princes Courts of Italie, to ſeeme idle when they be earneſtly occupied &amp; entend to nothing but miſchieuous practizes, and do buſily ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiat by coulor of otiation. Or as others of them that go ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to Church and neuer pray to winne an opinion of holineſſe: or pray ſtill apace, but neuer do good deede, and geue a begger a penny and ſpend a pound on a harlot, to ſpeake faire to a mans face, and foule behinde his backe, to ſet him at his trencher and yet
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:11025:129"/>
ſit on his skirts for ſo we vſe to ſay by a fayned friend, then alſo to be rough and churliſh in ſpeach and apparance, but inwardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and fauouring, as I haue ſene of the greateſt podeſtates and graueſt iudges and Preſidentes of Parliament in Fraunce.</p>
               <p>Theſe &amp; many ſuch like diſguiſings do we find in mans beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, &amp; ſpecially in the Courtiers of forraine Countreyes, where in my youth I was brought vp, and very well obſerued their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life and conuerſation, for of mine owne Countrey I haue not made ſo great experience. Which parts, neuertheleſſe, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not now in our Engliſh maker, becauſe we haue geuen him the name of an honeſt man, and not of an hypocrite: and therefore leauing theſe manner of diſſimulations to all baſe-minded men, &amp; of vile nature or miſterie, we doe allow our Courtly Poet to be a diſſembler only in the ſubtilties of his arte: that is, when he is moſt artificiall, ſo to diſguiſe and cloake it as it may not appeare, nor ſeeme to proceede from him by any ſtudie or trade of rules, but to be his naturall: nor ſo euidently to be deſcried, as euery ladde that reades him ſhall ſay he is a good ſcholler, but will rather haue him to know his arte well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and little to vſe it.</p>
               <p>And yet peraduenture in all points it may not be ſo taken, but in ſuch onely as may diſcouer his groſſenes or his ignorance by ſome ſchollerly affectation: which thing is very irkeſome to all men of good trayning, and ſpecially to Courtiers. And yet for all that our maker may not be in all caſes reſtrayned, but that he may both vſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo manifeſt his arte to his great praiſe, and need no more be aſhamed thereof, than a ſhomaker to haue made a cleanly ſhoe, or a Carpenter to haue buylt a faire houſe. Therefore to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe and make this point ſomewhat cleerer, to weete, where arte ought to appeare, and where not, and when the naturall is more commendable than the artificiall in any humane action or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, we wil examine it further by this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes we ſay arte is an ayde and coadiutor to nature, and a furtherer of her actions to good effect, or peraduenture a meane to ſupply her wants, by renforcing the cauſes wherein ſhee is impotent and defectiue, as doth the arte of phiſicke, by helping the naturall concoction, retention, diſtribution, expulſion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, in a weake and vnhealthie bodie. Or as the good gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:11025:130"/>
ſeaſons his ſoyle by ſundrie ſorts of compoſt: as mucke or marle, clay or ſande, and many times by bloud, or lees of oyle or wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſtale, or perchaunce with more coſtly drugs: and waters his plants, and weedes his herbes and floures, and prunes his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and vnleaues his boughes to let in the ſunne: and twentie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waies cheriſheth them, and cureth their infirmities, and ſo makes that neuer, or very ſeldome any of them miſcarry, but bring foorth their flours and fruites in ſeaſon. And in both theſe caſes it is no ſmal praiſe for the Phiſition &amp; Gardiner to be called good and cunning artificers.</p>
               <p>In another reſpect arte is not only an aide and coadiutor to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all her actions, but an alterer of them, and in ſome ſort a ſurmounter of her skill, ſo as by meanes of it her owne effects ſhall appeare more beautifull or ſtraunge and miraculous, as in both caſes before remembred. The Phiſition by the cordials hee will geue his patient, ſhall be able not onely to reſtore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed ſpirites of man, and render him health, but alſo to prolong the terme of his life many yeares ouer and aboue the ſtint of his firſt and naturall conſtitution. And the Gardiner by his arte will not onely make an herbe, or flowr, or fruite, come forth in his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without impediment, but alſo will embelliſh the ſame in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhape, odour and taſte, that nature of herſelfe woulde neuer haue done: as to make the ſingle gillifloure, or marigold, or daiſie, double: and the white roſe, redde, yellow, or carnation, a bitter mellon ſweete; a ſweete apple, ſoure; a plumme or cherrie without a ſtone; a peare without core or kernell, a goord or coucumber like to a horne, or any other figure he will: any of which things nature could not doe without mans help and arte. Theſe actions alſo are moſt ſingular, when they be moſt artificiall.</p>
               <p>In another reſpect, we ſay arte is neither an aider nor a ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but onely a bare immitatour of natures works, following and counterfeyting her actions and effects, as the Marmeſot doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny countenances and geſtures of man, of which ſorte are the artes of painting and keruing, whereof one repreſents the naturall by light colour and ſhadow in the ſuperficiall or flat, the other in a body maſſife expreſſing the full and emptie, euen, extant, rabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hollow, or whatſoeuer other figure and paſſion of quantitie.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:11025:130"/>
So alſo the Alchimiſt counterfeits gold, ſiluer, and all other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the Lapidarie pearles and pretious ſtones by glaſſe and other ſubſtances falſified, and ſophiſticate by arte. Theſe men alſo be praiſed for their craft, and their credit is nothing empayred, to ſay that their concluſions and effects are very artificiall. Finally in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reſpect arte is as it were an encountrer and contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, producing effects neither like to hers, nor by participation with her operations, nor by imitation of her paternes, but makes things and produceth effects altogether ſtrange and diuerſe, &amp; of ſuch forme &amp; qualitie (nature alwaies ſupplying ſtuffe) as ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would nor could haue done of her ſelfe, as the carpenter that builds a houſe, the ioyner that makes a table or a bedſtead, the tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor a garment, the Smith a locke or a key, and a number of like, in which caſe the workman gaineth reputation by his arte, and praiſe when it is beſt expreſſed &amp; moſt appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; moſt ſtudiouſly. Man alſo in all his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that be not altogether naturall, but are gotten by ſtudy &amp; diſcipline or exerciſe, as to daunce by meaſures to ſing by note, to play on the lute, and ſuch like, it is a praiſe to be ſaid an artificiall dauncer, ſinger, &amp; player on inſtruments, becauſe they be not exactly knowne or done, but by rules &amp; precepts or teaching of ſchoolemaſters. But in ſuch actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as be ſo naturall &amp; proper to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>an, as he may become excellent therein without any arte or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at all, (cuſtome and exerciſe excepted, which are requiſite to euery action not numbred among the vitall or animal) and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in nature ſhould ſeeme to do amiſſe, and man ſuffer reproch to be found deſtitute of them: in thoſe to ſhew himſelfe rather artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all then naturall, were no leſſe to be laughed at, then for one that can ſee well inough, to vſe a paire of ſpectacles, or not to heare but by a trunke put to his eare, nor feele without a paire of ennealed glooues, which things in deed helpe an infirme ſence, but annoy the perfit, and therefore ſhewing a diſabilitie naturall mooue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſcorne then commendation, and to pitie ſooner then to prayſe. But what elſe is language and vtterance, and diſcourſe &amp; perſuaſion, and argument in man, then the vertues of a well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute body and minde, little leſſe naturall then his very ſenſuall actions, ſauing that the one is perfited by nature at once, the other not without exerciſe &amp; iteration? Peraduenture alſo it wilbe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:11025:131"/>
that a man ſees better and diſcernes more brimly his collours, and heares and feeles more exactly by vſe and often hearing and feeling and ſeing, &amp; though it be better to ſee with ſpectacles then not to ſee at all, yet is their praiſe not egall nor in any mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comparable: no more is that which a Poet makes by arte and precepts rather then by naturall inſtinct: and that which he doth by long meditation rather then by a ſuddaine inſpiration, or with great pleaſure and facillitie then hardly (and as they are woont to ſay) in ſpite of Nature or Minerua, then which nothing can be more irkſome or ridiculous.</p>
               <p>And yet I am not ignorant that there be artes and methodes both to ſpeake and to perſwade and alſo to diſpute, and by which the naturall is in ſome ſorte relieued, as th'eye by his ſpectacle, I ſay relieued in his imperfection, but not made more perfit then the naturall, in which reſpect I call thoſe artes of Grammer, <hi>Logicke,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> not bare imitations, as the painter or keruers craft and worke in a forraine ſubiect viz. a liuely purtraite in his table of wood, but by long and ſtudious obſeruation rather a repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or reminiſcens naturall, reduced into perfection, and made prompt by vſe and exerciſe. And ſo whatſoeuer a man ſpeakes or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades he doth it not by imitation artificially, but by obſeruation naturally (though one follow another) becauſe it is both the ſame and the like that nature doth ſuggeſt: but if a popingay ſpeake, ſhe doth it by imitation of mans voyce artificially and not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally being the like, but not the ſame that nature doth ſuggeſt to man. But now becauſe our maker or Poet is to play many parts and not one alone, as firſt to deuiſe his plat or ſubiect, then to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion his poeme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thirdly to vſe his metricall proportions, and laſt of all to vtter with pleaſure and delight, which reſtes in his maner of language and ſtile as hath bene ſaid, whereof the many moodes and ſtraunge phraſes are called figures, it is not altogether with him as with the crafts man, nor altogither otherwiſe then with the crafts man, for in that he vſeth his metricall proportions by appointed and harmonicall meaſures and diſtaunces, he is like the Carpenter or Ioyner, for borrowing their tymber and ſtuffe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they appoint and order it by art otherwiſe then nature would doe, and worke effects in apparance contrary to hers. Alſo in that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:11025:131"/>
which the Poet ſpeakes or reports of another mans tale or doings, as <hi>Homer</hi> of <hi>Priamus</hi> or <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> he is as the painter or keruer that worke by imitation and repreſentation in a forrein ſubiect, in that he ſpeakes figuratiuely, or argues ſubtillie, or perſwades copiouſly and vehemently, he doth as the cunning gardiner that vſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a coadiutor, furders her concluſions &amp; many times makes her effectes more abſolute and ſtraunge. But for that in our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or Poet, which reſtes onely in deuiſe and iſſues from an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſharpe and quick inuention, holpen by a cleare and bright phantaſie and imagination, he is not as the painter to counterfaite the naturall by the like effects and not the ſame, nor as the gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aiding nature to worke both the ſame and the like, nor as the Carpenter to worke effectes vtterly vnlike, but euen as nature her ſelfe working by her owne peculiar vertue and proper inſtinct and not by example or meditation or exerciſe as all other artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers do, is then moſt admired when he is moſt naturall and leaſt artificiall. And in the feates of his language and vtterance, becauſe they hold aſwell of nature to be ſuggeſted and vttered as by arte to be poliſhed and reformed. Therefore ſhall our Poet receaue prayſe for both, but more by knowing of his arte then by vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vſing it, and be more commended for his naturall eloquence then for his artificiall, and more for his artificiall well deſembled, then for the ſame ouermuch affected and groſſely or vndiſcretly bewrayed, as many makers and Oratours do.</p>

               <p>ANd with this (my moſt gratious ſoueraigne Lady) I make an end, humbly beſeeching your pardon, in that I haue preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hold your eares ſo long annoyed with a tedious trifle, ſo as vnleſſe it proceede more of your owne Princely and naturall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetude then of my merite, I feare greatly leaſt you may thinck of me as the Philoſopher Plato did of <hi>Amceris</hi> an inhabitant of the Citie <hi>Cirene,</hi> who being in troth a very actiue and artificiall man in driuing of a Princes Charriot or Coche (as your Maieſtie might be) and knowing it himſelfe well enough, comming one day into Platos ſchoole, and hauing heard him largely diſpute in matters

Philoſophicall, I pray you (quoth he) geue me leaue alſo to ſay ſomewhat of myne arte, and in deede ſhewed ſo many trickes of his cunning how to lanche forth and ſtay, and chaunge pace, and turne and winde his Coche, this way and that way, vphill downe hill, and alſo in euen or rough ground, that he made the whole aſſemblie wonder at him. Quoth Plato being a graue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, verely in myne opinion this man ſhould be vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for any ſeruice of greater importance then to driue a Coche. It is great pitie that ſo prettie a fellow, had not occupied his braynes in ſtudies of more conſequence. Now I pray God it be not thought ſo of me in deſcribing the toyes of this our vulgar art. But when I conſider how euery thing hath his eſtimation by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, and that it was but the ſtudie of my yonger yeares in which vanitie raigned. Alſo that I write to the pleaſure of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a moſt gratious Queene, and neither to Prieſtes nor to Prophetes or Philoſophers. Beſides finding by experience, that many times idleneſſe is leſſe harmefull then vnprofitable occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dayly ſeeing how theſe great aſpiring mynds and ambitious heads of the world ſeriouſly ſearching to deale in matters of ſtate, be often times ſo buſie and earneſt that they were better be vnoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, and peraduenture altogether idle, I preſume ſo much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Maieſties moſt milde and gracious iudgement howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you conceiue of myne abilitie to any better or greater ſeruice, that yet in this attempt ye wil allow of my loyall and good intent alwayes endeuouring to do your Maieſtie the beſt and greateſt of thoſe ſeruices I can.</p>
